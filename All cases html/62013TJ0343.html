Under Rule 201(9) (now Rule 215(9)), petitions as a general rule become public documents, and the name of the petitioner and the contents of the petition may be published by the Parliament for reasons of transparency. Consequently, the submission of a petition implies, in principle, that notice is given thereof, allowing other citizens to support the signatory.
