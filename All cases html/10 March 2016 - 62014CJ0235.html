               <p class="normal">Safe challenged BBVA’s decision to close its account and similar decisions by the other two banks before the Juzgado de lo Mercantil No 5 de Barcelona (Commercial Court No 5, Barcelona), on the ground that closure of the accounts was an act of unfair competition which prevented it from operating normally by transferring funds to States other than the State in which it is established. Safe submitted that it was legally required to have an account with a banking institution in order to be able to carry out such transfers of funds — operations which it performed at the banks — and that it competed with the banks in the market. It also contended that the banks had asked it to provide data relating to its customers and the origin and destination of the funds, on the pretext of the provisions of Law 10/2010, a contention which the banks dispute, and that providing the banks with that information was contrary to national data protection legislation.</p>

On the other hand, it held that BBVA’s conduct was justified because it was based on checks which showed that 22% of transfers made through Safe’s accounts during the period from 1 September to 30 November 2010 were not carried out by agents who had been authorised by Safe and were listed with the Bank of Spain. Moreover, during that period transfers were made by 1291 persons, which far exceeded the number of Safe’s agents. In addition, an expert report had highlighted the risks of transfers not conducted by identified agents.</p>

Secondly, in Spain only Sepblac may access data relating to the customers of payment institutions. Thirdly, even if BBVA was required to adopt such due diligence measures, it had to conduct a detailed and exhaustive study of Safe’s policy for complying with the relevant legislation prior to adopting them. In the present case, BBVA had merely requested an expert report which had been prepared using BBVA’s data.

BBVA requested information from Safe pursuant to Law 10/2010 and, after Safe refused to provide that information, closed its account. Whilst Article 9 of that law authorises the application of simplified customer due diligence measures in so far as the customers are financial institutions whose compliance with due diligence measures is supervised, under Article 11 of the law enhanced customer due diligence measures must be adopted in situations which, on the basis of a risk analysis, can present a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.

Furthermore, the institutions and persons covered by the directive are authorised to apply simplified due diligence measures ‘in line with a risk-based approach’ in appropriate cases only, as recital 22 of the directive states. It is apparent from recital 24 of the directive that, although the identity and business profile of all customers should be established, there are cases where particularly rigorous customer identification and verification procedures are required on account of a greater risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
