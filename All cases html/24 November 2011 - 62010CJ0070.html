         audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant claims to hold intellectual property rights, with a view to blocking the
         transfer of files the sharing of which infringes copyright.
      </P>
      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">Such an injunction addressed to that internet service provider would oblige it actively to monitor all the data relating to
         each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual-property right, thus requiring general monitoring
         prohibited by Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31. It would, moreover, result in a serious infringement of the freedom of the
         internet service provider concerned to conduct its business since it would require that provider to install a complicated,
         costly, permanent computer system at its own expense, which would also be contrary to the conditions laid down in Article
         3(1) of Directive 2004/48, which requires measures to ensure the respect of intellectual-property rights not to be unnecessarily
         complicated or costly. Therefore such an injunction would not meet the requirement that a fair balance be struck between,
         on the one hand, the protection of the intellectual-property right enjoyed by copyright holders, and, on the other hand, that
         of the freedom to conduct business enjoyed by operators such as internet service providers. The effects of such an injunction
         would not be limited, moreover, to those internet service providers, as the filtering system may also infringe the fundamental
         rights of their customers, namely, their right to protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart
         information, those rights being safeguarded by Articles 8 and 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
         respectively. First, the injunction would involve a systematic analysis of all content and the collection and identification
         of users&#8217; IP addresses from which unlawful content on the network is sent. Those addresses are protected personal data, for
         they allow those users to be precisely identified. Second, the injunction would be likely to prejudice freedom of information
         since that system would be unlikely to distinguish adequately between unlawful content and lawful content, with the result
         that its introduction could lead to the blocking of lawful communications.

         a transparent method of file sharing which is independent, decentralised and features advanced search and download functions.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point18">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24&nbsp;June 2004, SABAM accordingly brought interlocutory proceedings against Scarlet before the President of the Tribunal

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point19">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SABAM sought, first, a declaration that the copyright in musical works contained in its repertoire had been infringed, in

         electronic music files by means of peer-to-peer software, those infringements being committed through the use of Scarlet&#8217;s

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point20">20</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SABAM also sought an order requiring Scarlet to bring such infringements to an end by blocking, or making it impossible for

         of the rightholders, on pain of a periodic penalty. Lastly, SABAM requested that Scarlet provide it with details of the measures
         that it would be applying in order to comply with the judgment to be given, on pain of a periodic penalty.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point21">21</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By judgment of 26&nbsp;November 2004, the President of the Tribunal de premi&egrave;re instance, Brussels, found that copyright had been
         infringed, as claimed by SABAM, but, prior to ruling on the application for cessation, appointed an expert to investigate
         whether the technical solutions proposed by SABAM were technically feasible, whether they would make it possible to filter
         out only unlawful file sharing, and whether there were other ways of monitoring the use of peer-to-peer software, and to determine

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point23">23</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By judgment of 29&nbsp;June 2007, the President of the Tribunal de premi&egrave;re instance, Brussels, accordingly ordered Scarlet to

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point24">24</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarlet appealed against that decision to the referring court, claiming, first, that it was impossible for it to comply with
         that injunction since the effectiveness and permanence of filtering and blocking systems had not been proved and that the
         installation of the equipment for so doing was faced with numerous practical obstacles, such as problems with the network
         capacity and the impact on the network. Moreover, any attempt to block the files concerned was, it argued, doomed to fail
         in the very short term because there were at that time several peer-to-peer software products which made it impossible for
         third parties to check their content.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point25">25</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarlet also claimed that that injunction was contrary to Article 21 of the Law of 11&nbsp;March 2003 on certain legal aspects
         of information society services, which transposes Article 15 of Directive 2000/31 into national law, because it would impose
         on Scarlet, <I>de facto</I>, a general obligation to monitor communications on its network, inasmuch as any system for blocking or filtering peer-to-peer
         traffic would necessarily require general surveillance of all the communications passing through its network.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point26">26</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Scarlet considered that the installation of a filtering system would be in breach of the provisions of European Union
         law on the protection of personal data and the secrecy of communications, since such filtering involves the processing of
         IP addresses, which are personal data. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point27">27</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, the referring court took the view that, before ascertaining whether a mechanism for filtering and blocking
         peer-to-peer files existed and could be effective, it had to be satisfied that the obligations liable to be imposed on Scarlet
         were in accordance with European Union law.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point28">28</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, the cour d&#8217;appel de Bruxelles decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point30">30</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it should first be recalled that, under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29 and the third sentence of Article

         as ISPs, whose services are being used by a third party to infringe their rights.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point31">31</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it follows from the Court&#8217;s case-law that the jurisdiction conferred on national courts, in accordance with those provisions,
         must allow them to order those intermediaries to take measures aimed not only at bringing to an end infringements already
         committed against intellectual-property rights using their information-society services, but also at preventing further infringements
         (see, to that effect, Case C&#8209;324/09 <I>L&#8217;Or&eacute;al and Others </I>[2011] ECR I&#8209;0000, paragraph 131).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point32">32</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it follows from that same case-law that the rules for the operation of the injunctions for which the Member States
         must provide under Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/29 and the third sentence of Article 11 of Directive 2004/48, such as those
         relating to the conditions to be met and to the procedure to be followed, are a matter for national law (see, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>, <I>L&#8217;Or&eacute;al and Others</I>, paragraph 135).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point33">33</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, those national rules, and likewise their application by the national courts, must observe the limitations arising

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, those rules must, in particular, respect Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31, which prohibits national authorities

         its network. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point36">36</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, the Court has already ruled that that prohibition applies in particular to national measures which would require
         an intermediary provider, such as an ISP, to actively monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any
         future infringement of intellectual-property rights. Furthermore, such a general monitoring obligation would be incompatible
         with Article 3 of Directive 2004/48, which states that the measures referred to by the directive must be fair and proportionate
         and must not be excessively costly (see <I>L&#8217;Or&eacute;al and Others</I>, paragraph 139). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point37">37</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, it is necessary to examine whether the injunction at issue in the main proceedings, which would require

         of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual-property rights. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point38">38</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it is common ground that implementation of that filtering system would require

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point39">39</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive monitoring of this kind would thus require active observation of all electronic communications conducted on the

         that network. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point40">40</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the foregoing, it must be held that the injunction imposed on the ISP concerned requiring it to install the
         contested filtering system would oblige it to actively monitor all the data relating to each of its customers in order to
         prevent any future infringement of intellectual-property rights. It follows that that injunction would require the ISP to
         carry out general monitoring, something which is prohibited by Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point41">41</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to assess whether that injunction is consistent with European Union law, account must also be taken of the requirements
         that stem from the protection of the applicable fundamental rights, such as those mentioned by the referring court. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it should be recalled that the injunction at issue in the main proceedings pursues the aim of ensuring the
         protection of copyright, which is an intellectual-property right, which may be infringed by the nature and content of certain
         electronic communications conducted through the network of the ISP concerned. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of the right to intellectual property is indeed enshrined in Article&nbsp;17(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
         of the European Union (&#8216;the Charter&#8217;). There is, however, nothing whatsoever in the wording of that provision or in the Court&#8217;s
         case-law to suggest that that right is inviolable and must for that reason be absolutely protected. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point44">44</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As paragraphs 62 to 68 of the judgment in Case C&#8209;275/06 <I>Promusicae</I> [2008] ECR I&#8209;271 make clear, the protection of the fundamental right to property, which includes the rights linked to intellectual
         property, must be balanced against the protection of other fundamental rights. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, it follows from paragraph 68 of that judgment that, in the context of measures adopted to protect copyright
         holders, national authorities and courts must strike a fair balance between the protection of copyright and the protection
         of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, national authorities and courts must, in particular,
         strike a fair balance between the protection of the intellectual property right enjoyed by copyright holders and that of the
         freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as ISPs pursuant to Article 16 of the Charter.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present case, the injunction requiring the installation of the contested filtering system involves monitoring all the
         electronic communications made through the network of the ISP concerned in the interests of those rightholders. Moreover,
         that monitoring has no limitation in time, is directed at all future infringements and is intended to protect not only existing
         works, but also future works that have not yet been created at the time when the system is introduced.  
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, such an injunction would result in a serious infringement of the freedom of the ISP concerned to conduct its
         business   since it would require that ISP to install a complicated, costly, permanent computer system at its own expense,
         which would also be contrary to the conditions laid down in Article 3(1) of Directive 2004/48, which requires that measures
         to ensure the respect of intellectual-property rights should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, it must be held that the injunction to install the contested filtering system is to be regarded as
         not respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between, on the one hand, the protection of the intellectual-property
         right enjoyed by copyright holders, and, on the other hand, that of the freedom to conduct business enjoyed by operators such
         as ISPs. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the effects of that injunction would not be limited to the ISP concerned, as the contested filtering system may
         also infringe the fundamental rights of that ISP&#8217;s customers, namely their right to protection of their personal data and
         their freedom to receive or impart information, which are rights safeguarded by Articles 8 and 11 of the Charter respectively.
         
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common ground, first, that the injunction requiring installation of the contested filtering system would involve a systematic
         analysis of all content and the collection and identification of users&#8217; IP addresses from which unlawful content on the network
         is sent. Those addresses are protected personal data because they allow those users to be precisely identified. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that injunction could potentially undermine freedom of information since that system might not distinguish adequately
         between unlawful content and lawful content, with the result that its introduction could lead to the blocking of lawful communications.
         Indeed, it is not contested that the reply to the question whether a transmission is lawful also depends on the application
         of statutory exceptions to copyright which vary from one Member State to another. Moreover, in some Member States certain
         works fall within the public domain or can be posted online free of charge by the authors concerned. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it must be held that, in adopting the injunction requiring the ISP to install the contested filtering system,
         the national court concerned would not be respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between the right to intellectual
         property, on the one hand, and the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to
         receive or impart information, on the other. 
      </P>
