That legislation, which is relevant to the resolution of the case in the main proceedings, introduced two new alternative criteria for determining the degree of seriousness of an offence. The first is a substantive criterion, relating to conduct which corresponds to criminal classifications the criminal nature of which is specific and serious, and which is particularly harmful to individual and collective legal interests. Moreover, the national legislature relied on a formal normative criterion, based on the penalty prescribed for the offence in question. The threshold of three years’ imprisonment envisaged by that criterion does, however, cover the great majority of offences. In addition, the referring court considers that the State’s interest in punishing criminal conduct cannot justify disproportionate interferences with the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter.</p>
