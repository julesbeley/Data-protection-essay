It also found that there was no reason to maintain the legal effects of the decision, since the Minister, contrary to Article 35(2) of the Wbp, had not given access to the legal analysis in the minute from which it might have become evident why M could not be considered to be a refugee for the purposes of Article 29(1)(a) of the Vw 2000.</p>

Consequently the right of access which that applicant may rely on under Article 12(a) of Directive 95/46 and Article 8(2) of the Charter relates solely to those data.

The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, inter alia, the judgment in <span class="italic">Márquez Samohano</span>, C‑190/13, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A146&lang=EN&format=pdf&target=null"

The wording of the questions and the information concerning them in the orders for reference are, furthermore, sufficiently clear to determine the scope of those questions and to enable, first, the Court to answer them and, secondly, the interested parties to submit their observations pursuant to Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

By contrast, the Netherlands, Czech, French, Austrian and Portuguese Governments and the Commission consider that Article 41 of the Charter is directed exclusively at the EU institutions and cannot, therefore, establish a right of access to a file in the context of a national procedure.</p>
