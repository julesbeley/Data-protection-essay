      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point2">2.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system for processing personal data relating to Union citizens who are not nationals of the Member State concerned, putting
         in place a central register of foreign nationals and having as its object the provision of support to the national authorities
         responsible for the application of the law relating to the right of residence does not satisfy the requirement of necessity
         laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data
         and on the free movement of such data, interpreted in the light of the prohibition on any discrimination on grounds of nationality,
         unless:
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">&#8211; it contains only the data which are necessary for the application by those authorities of that legislation, and</P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">&#8211; its centralised nature enables that legislation to be more effectively applied as regards the right of residence of Union
         citizens who are not nationals of that Member State.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">It is for the national court to ascertain whether those conditions are satisfied. </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Having regard to the objective of Directive 95/46 of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in all Member States, the
         concept of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of the directive cannot have a meaning which varies between the Member States.
         It follows that what is at issue is a concept which has its own independent meaning in Community law.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">As regards the use of a central register of foreign nationals for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating
         to the right of residence, it is necessary for a Member State, within the meaning of Article 7(e), to have the relevant particulars
         and documents available to it in order to ascertain, within the framework laid down under the applicable Community legislation,
         whether a right of residence in its territory exists in relation to a national of another Member State and to establish that
         there are no grounds which would justify a restriction on that right. It follows that the use of a register for the purpose
         of providing support to the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence
         is, in principle, legitimate and, having regard to its nature, compatible with the prohibition of discrimination on grounds
         of nationality laid down by Article&nbsp;12(1) EC. However, such a register must not contain any information other than what is
         necessary for that purpose. In that regard, as Community law presently stands, the processing of personal data contained in
         the documents referred to in Articles 8(3) and 27(1) of Directive 2004/38 on the right of citizens of the Union and their
         family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation No 1612/68 and repealing
         Directives 64/221, 68/360, 72/194, 73/148, 75/34, 75/35, 90/364, 90/365 and 93/96 must be considered to be necessary, within
         the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">With respect to the necessity that a centralised register be available in order to meet the requirements of the authorities
         responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, even if it were to be assumed that
         decentralised registers such as district population registers contain all the data which are relevant for the purposes of
         allowing the authorities to undertake their duties, the centralisation of those data could be necessary, within the meaning
         of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, if it contributes to the more effective application of that legislation as regards the
         right of residence of Union citizens who wish to reside in a Member State of which they are not nationals.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">The storage and processing of personal data containing individualised personal information in such a register for statistical
         purposes cannot, on any basis, be considered to be necessary within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46. While
         Community law has not excluded the power of Member States to adopt measures enabling the national authorities to have an exact
         knowledge of population movements affecting their territory, the exercise of that power does not, of itself, mean that the
         collection and storage of individualised personal information is necessary. It is only anonymous information that requires
         to be processed in order for such an objective to be attained.
      </P>

      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point3">3.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 12(1) EC must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the putting in place by a Member State, for the purpose
         of fighting crime, of a system for processing personal data specific to Union citizens who are not nationals of that Member
         State.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">The principle of non-discrimination, which has its basis in Articles 12 EC and 43 EC, requires that comparable situations
         must not be treated differently and that different situations must not be treated in the same way. Such treatment may be justified
         only if it is based on objective considerations independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and is proportionate
         to the objective being legitimately pursued.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">While it is true that the objective of fighting crime is a legitimate one, it cannot be relied on in order to justify the
         systematic processing of personal data when that processing is restricted to the data of Union citizens who are not nationals
         of the Member State concerned. The fight against crime necessarily involves the prosecution of crimes and offences committed,
         irrespective of the nationality of their perpetrators. It follows that, as regards a Member State, the situation of its nationals
         cannot, as regards the objective of fighting crime, be different from that of Union citizens who are not nationals of that
         Member State and who are resident in its territory. Therefore, a difference in treatment between those nationals and those
         Union citizens which arises by virtue of the systematic processing of personal data relating only to Union citizens who are
         not nationals of the Member State concerned for the purposes of fighting crime constitutes discrimination which is prohibited
         by Article 12(1) EC.

         that the general processing, through the AZR, of data regarding a Union citizen who is not a German national constitutes a
         restriction of Articles 49 EC and 50 EC which cannot be justified by the objective of the swift treatment of cases relating
         to the right of residence of foreign nationals. In addition, that court took the view that the storage and processing of the
         data at issue were contrary to Articles 12 EC and 18 EC, as well as Articles&nbsp;6(1)(b) and 7(e) of  Directive 95/46.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point34">34</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bundesrepublik Deutschland, acting through the Bundesamt, brought an appeal against that judgment before the Oberverwaltungsgericht
         f&uuml;r das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen (Higher Administrative Court for the <I>Land </I>North-Rhine Westphalia), which considers that certain of the questions of law raised before it require an interpretation of
         Community law by the Court.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the national court notes that, according to the Court&#8217;s case-law, a citizen of the European Union lawfully resident
         in the territory of a Member State of which he is not a national can rely on Article 12 EC in all situations which fall within
         the scope of Community law. It refers in that regard to Case C&#8209;85/96 <I>Mart&iacute;nez Sala </I>[1998] ECR I&#8209;2691, paragraph 63; Case C-184/99 <I>Grzelczyk</I> [2001] ECR I-6193, paragraph 32; and Case C-209/03 <I>Bidar </I>[2005] ECR I-2119, paragraph 32. Accordingly, having exercised the right to the freedom of movement conferred on him by Article
         18(1) EC, Mr Huber was entitled to rely on the prohibition of discrimination laid down by Article 12 EC.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point36">36</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national court states that the general processing of personal data relating to Mr Huber in the AZR differs from the processing
         of data relating to a German national in two respects: first, some of the data relating to Mr Huber are stored not only in
         the register of the district in which he resides but also in the AZR, and, secondly, the AZR contains additional data. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point37">37</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national court doubts whether such a difference in treatment can be justified by the need to monitor the residence of
         foreign nationals in Germany. It also raises the question whether the general processing of personal data relating to Union
         citizens who are not German nationals and who reside or have resided in Germany is proportionate to the objective of protecting
         public security, inasmuch as the AZR covers all of those citizens and not only those who are subject to an expulsion order
         or a prohibition on residing in Germany.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point38">38</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the national court is of the opinion that, in the circumstances of the main proceedings, Mr Huber falls within the
         scope of application of Article 43 EC. Since the freedom of establishment extends not only to the taking up of activities
         as a self-employed person but also the framework conditions for that activity, the national court raises the question whether
         the general processing of data relating to Mr Huber in the AZR is liable to affect those conditions to such an extent that
         it comprises a restriction on the exercise of that freedom.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point39">39</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the national court raises the question whether the criterion of necessity imposed by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46
         can be a criterion for assessing a system of general data processing such as the system put in place under the AZR. The national
         court does not, in fact, rule out the possibility that the directive may leave it open to the national legislature itself
         to define that requirement of necessity. However, should that not be the case, the question arises how that requirement is
         to be understood, and more particularly whether the objective of administrative simplification might justify data processing
         of the kind put in place by the AZRG.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point40">40</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, the Oberverwaltungsgericht f&uuml;r das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen decided to stay the proceedings and refer

      <P class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<I>Preliminary observations</I></P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point41">41</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its questions, the national court asks the Court whether the processing of personal data which is undertaken in a register
         such as the AZR is compatible with Community law. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it must be noted that Paragraph 1(2) of the AZRG provides that, through the storage of certain personal data
         relating to foreign nationals in the AZR and the making available of those data, the Bundesamt, which is responsible for maintaining
         that register, assists the public authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the law on foreign
         nationals and the law on asylum, together with other public bodies. In particular, the German Government has stated in its
         written observations that the AZR is used for statistical purposes and on the exercise by the security and police services
         and by the judicial authorities of their powers in relation to the prosecution and investigation of activities which are criminal
         or threaten public security. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, it must be stated that data such as those which, according to the order for reference, the AZR contains in
         relation to Mr Huber constitute personal data within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46, because they represent
         &#8216;information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person&#8217;. Their collection, storage and transmission by the
         body responsible for the management of the register in which they are kept thus represents the &#8216;processing of personal data&#8217;
         within the meaning of Article 2(b) of that directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point44">44</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46 expressly excludes from its scope of application, inter alia, the processing of personal
         data concerning public security, defence, State security and the activities of  the State in areas of criminal law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, while the processing of personal data for the purposes of the application of the legislation relating to
         the right of residence and for statistical purposes falls within the scope of application of Directive 95/46, the position
         is otherwise where the objective of processing those data is connected with the fight against crime.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the compatibility with Community law of the processing of personal data undertaken through a register such as
         the AZR should be examined, first, in the context of its function of providing support to the authorities responsible for
         the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and to its use for statistical purposes, by having regard
         to Directive 95/46 and more particularly, in view of the third question, to the condition of necessity laid down by Article
         7(e) of that directive, as interpreted in the light of the requirements of the Treaty including in particular the prohibition
         of any discrimination on grounds of nationality under Article 12(1) EC, and, secondly, in the context of its function in the
         fight against crime, by having regard to primary Community law.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 1 of Directive 95/46 requires Member States to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter II of Directive 95/46, entitled &#8216;General rules on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data&#8217;, provides that,
         subject to the exceptions permitted under Article 13, all processing of personal data must comply, first, with the principles
         relating to data quality set out in Article 6 of the directive and, secondly, with one of the criteria for making data processing
         legitimate listed in Article 7 (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-465/00, C-138/01 and C-139/01 <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others </I>[2003] ECR I&#8209;4989, paragraph 65).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Article 7(e) provides that personal data may lawfully be processed if &#8216;it is necessary for the performance
         of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third
         party to whom the data are disclosed&#8217;.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, it must be noted that Directive 95/46 is intended, as appears from the eighth recital in the preamble thereto,
         to ensure that the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of personal
         data is equivalent in all Member States. The tenth recital adds that the approximation of the national laws applicable in
         this area must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high
         level of protection in the Community.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it has been held that the harmonisation of those national laws is not limited to minimal harmonisation but amounts to
         harmonisation which is generally complete (see Case C-101/01 <I>Lindqvist</I> [2003] ECR I&#8209;12971, paragraph 96).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, having regard to the objective of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in all Member States, the concept
         of necessity laid down by Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, the purpose of which is to delimit precisely one of the situations
         in which the processing of personal data is lawful, cannot have a meaning which varies between the Member States. It therefore
         follows that what is at issue is a concept which has its own independent meaning in Community law and which must be interpreted
         in a manner which fully reflects the objective of that directive, as laid down in Article 1(1) thereof.
      </P>
      <P class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;The necessity for the processing of personal data, such as the processing undertaken through the AZR, for the purpose of the
         application of the legislation relating to the right of residence and for statistical purposes 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is apparent from the order for reference that the AZR is a centralised register which contains certain personal data relating
         to Union citizens who are not German nationals and that it may be consulted by a number of public and private bodies. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the use of a register such as the AZR for the purpose of the application of the legislation relating to the right
         of residence, it is important to bear in mind that, as Community law presently stands, the right of free movement of a Union
         citizen in the territory of a Member State of which he is not a national is not unconditional but may be subject to the limitations
         and conditions imposed by the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect (see, to that effect, Case C&#8209;33/07 <I>Jippa </I>[2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Article 4 of Directive 68/360, read in conjunction with Article 1 thereof, and Article 6 of Directive 73/148, read in
         conjunction with Article 1 thereof, provided that, in order for a national of a Member State to be entitled to reside for
         a period of more than three months in the territory of another Member State, that person had to belong to one of the categories
         laid down by those directives and provided for that entitlement to be subject to certain formalities linked to the presentation
         or the provision by the applicant of a residence permit together with various documents and particulars.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point56">56</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Article 10 of Directive 68/360 and Article 8 of Directive 73/148 permitted Member States to derogate from the
         provisions of those directives on grounds of public policy, public security or public health and to limit the right of entry
         and residence of a national of another Member State in their territory.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point57">57</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Directive 2004/38, which fell to be transposed by 30 April 2006 and which accordingly did not apply at the time of the
         facts of the present case, repealed both of the abovementioned directives, it sets out, in Article 7, conditions which are
         generally equivalent to those laid down under its predecessors as regards the right of residence of nationals of other Member
         States and, in Article 27(1), restrictions relating to that right which are essentially identical to those laid down under
         its predecessors. It also provides, in Article 8(1), that the host Member State may require every Union citizen who is a national
         of another Member State and who wishes to reside in its territory for a period of more than three months to register with
         the relevant authorities. In that regard, the host Member State may, by virtue of Article 8(3), require certain documents
         and particulars to be provided in order to enable those authorities to determine that the conditions for entitlement to a
         right of residence are satisfied.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point58">58</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must therefore be held that it is necessary for a Member State to have the relevant particulars and documents available
         to it in order to ascertain, within the framework laid down under the applicable Community legislation, whether a right of
         residence in its territory exists in relation to a national of another Member State and to establish that there are no grounds
         which would justify a restriction on that right. It follows that the use of a register such as the AZR for the purpose of
         providing support to the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence
         is, in principle, legitimate and, having regard to its nature, compatible with the prohibition of discrimination on grounds
         of nationality laid down by Article 12(1) EC.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point59">59</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such a register must not contain any information other than what is necessary for that purpose. In that regard, as
         Community law presently stands, the processing of personal data contained in the documents referred to in Articles 8(3) and
         27(1) of Directive 2004/38 must be considered to be necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, for
         the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point60">60</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, while the collection of the data required for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence
         would be of no practical benefit if those data were not to be stored, it must be emphasised that, since a change in the personal
         situation of a party entitled to a right of residence may have an impact on his status in relation to that right, it is incumbent
         on the authority responsible for a register such as the AZR to ensure that the data which are stored are, where appropriate,
         brought up to date so that, first, they reflect the actual situation of the data subjects and, secondly, irrelevant data are
         removed from that register.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point61">61</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the detailed rules for the use of such a register for the purposes of the application of the legislation relating

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point62">62</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, with respect to the necessity that a centralised register such as the AZR be available in order to meet the requirements
         of the authorities responsible for the application of the legislation relating to the right of residence, even if it were
         to be assumed that decentralised registers such as the district population registers contain all the data which are relevant
         for the purposes of allowing the authorities to undertake their duties, the centralisation of those data could be necessary,
         within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, if it contributes to the more effective application of that legislation
         as regards the right of residence of Union citizens who wish to reside in a Member State of which they are not nationals.
         
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point63">63</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the statistical function of a register such as the AZR, it must be recalled that, by creating the principle of
         freedom of movement for persons and by conferring on any person falling within its ambit the right of access to the territory
         of the Member States for the purposes intended by the Treaty, Community law has not excluded the power of Member States to
         adopt measures enabling the national authorities to have an exact knowledge of population movements affecting their territory
         (see Case 118/75 <I>Watson and Belmann </I>[1976] ECR 1185, paragraph 17).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point64">64</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Regulation No 862/2007, which provides for the transmission of statistics relating to migratory flows in the territory
         of the Member States, presupposes that information will be collected by those States which allows those statistics to be determined.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point65">65</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the exercise of that power does not, of itself, mean that the collection and storage of individualised personal information
         in a register such as the AZR is necessary, within the meaning of Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46. As the Advocate General
         stated at point 23 of his Opinion, it is only anonymous information that requires to be processed in order for such an objective

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point66">66</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from all of the above that a system for processing personal data relating to Union citizens who are not nationals

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point73">73</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, since Mr Huber exercised his freedom to move and reside within that territory as conferred by Article

         to determine whether a system for the storage and processing of personal data such as that at issue in the main proceedings
         is compatible with the principle that any discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited, in so far as those data

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point74">74</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, it should be pointed out that the order for reference does not contain any detailed information which would

         if the national court were to consider that to be the case, the application of the principle of non-discrimination cannot
         vary depending on whether it finds its basis in that provision or on Article 12(1) EC, read in conjunction with Article 18(1)

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point75">75</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is settled case-law that the principle of non-discrimination, which has its basis in Articles 12 EC and 43 EC, requires

         Such treatment may be justified only if it is based on objective considerations independent of the nationality of the persons
