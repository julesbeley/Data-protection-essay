They refer in this respect, first, to the fact that, according to the legislation in force, the managing member of the DSK must always be an official of the Federal Chancellery. All day-to-day business of the DSK is thus de facto managed by a federal official, who remains bound by the instructions issued by his employer and is subject to supervision within the terms of Paragraph 45(1) of the BDG 1979. Paragraph 37(1) of the DSG 2000 provides only for the operational autonomy of the supervisory authority.</p>

In addition, the DSK office is exclusively responsible for the management of its action programmes. The DSK office staff comply with the instructions issued by the chairman and the managing member of the DSK. The fact that the staff of the office are, in legal terms, attached to the Federal Chancellery, both in terms of hierarchy and remuneration, does not affect their independence.
