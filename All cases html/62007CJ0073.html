      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point38">38</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its fourth question, which should be examined next, the national court asks, in essence, whether activities involving the
         processing of personal data such as those referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question and relating to personal
         data files which contain solely, and in unaltered form, material that has already been published in the media, fall within
         the scope of application of the directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point39">39</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By virtue of Article 3(2) of the directive, the directive does not apply to the processing of personal data in two situations.
         
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point40">40</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first situation involves the processing of personal data undertaken in the course of an activity which falls outside the
         scope of Community law, such as those provided for by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union and, in any case, to
         processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security (including the economic well-being of the State
         when the processing operation relates to State security matters) and the activities of the State in areas of criminal law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point41">41</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those activities, which are mentioned by way of example in the first indent of Article&nbsp;3(2) are, in any event, activities
         of the State or of State authorities unrelated to the fields of activity of individuals. They are intended to define the scope
         of the exception provided for there, with the result that that exception applies only to the activities which are expressly
         listed there or which can be classified in the same category (<I>ejusdem generis</I>) (see Case C-101/01 <I>Lindqvist</I> [2003] ECR I-12971, paragraphs 43 and 44).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities involving the processing of personal data of the kind referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question concern
         the activities of private companies. Those activities do not fall in any way within a framework established by the public
         authorities that relates to public security. Consequently, such activities cannot be assimilated to those covered by Article
         3(2) of the directive (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-317/04 and C-318/04 <I>Parliament </I>v <I>Council </I>[2006] ECR I&#8209;4721, paragraph 58). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second situation, which is covered by the second indent of that provision, recital 12 in the preamble to the
         directive &#8211; relating to that exception &#8211; mentions as examples of data processing carried out by a natural person in the course
         of a purely personal or household activity, correspondence and the holding of records of addresses.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point44">44</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that the latter exception must be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course
         of private or family life of individuals (see <I>Lindqvist</I>, paragraph 47). That clearly does not apply to the activities of Markkinap&ouml;rssi and Satamedia, the purpose of which is to
         make the data collected accessible to an unrestricted number of people. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must therefore be held that activities involving the processing of personal data of the kind referred to at points (c)
         and (d) of the first question are not covered by any of the situations referred to in Article 3(2) of the directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it should be pointed out that the directive does not lay down any further limitation of its scope of application.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, the Advocate General observes at point 125 of her Opinion that Article 13 of the directive permits derogations
         from its provisions only in certain cases, which do not extend to the provisions of Article 3.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it must be held that a general derogation from the application of the directive in respect of published information
         would largely deprive the directive of its effect. It would be sufficient for the Member States to publish data in order for
         those data to cease to enjoy the protection afforded by the directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the fourth question should therefore be that activities involving the processing of personal data such as those
         referred to at points (c) and (d) of the first question and relating to personal data files which contain solely, and in unaltered
         form, material that has already been published in the media, fall within the scope of application of the directive. 
      </P>
      <P class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<I>The second question</I></P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its second question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 9 of the directive should be interpreted as meaning
         that the activities referred to at points (a) to (d) of the first question, relating to data from documents which are in the
         public domain under national legislation, must be considered as activities involving the processing of personal data carried
         out solely for journalistic purposes. The national court states that it seeks clarification as to whether the fact that the
         principal aim of those activities is the publication of the data in question is relevant to the determination of that issue.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be observed, as a preliminary point, that, according to settled case-law, the provisions of a directive must be interpreted
         in the light of the aims pursued by the directive and the system it establishes (see, to that effect, Case C-265/07 <I>Caffaro</I> [2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 14).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it is not in dispute that, as is apparent from Article 1 of the directive, its objective is that the Member
         States should, while permitting the free flow of personal data, protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons
         and, in particular, their right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That objective cannot, however, be pursued without having regard to the fact that those fundamental rights must, to some degree,
         be reconciled with the fundamental right to freedom of expression.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 of the directive refers to such a reconciliation. As is apparent, in particular, from recital 37 in the preamble
         to the directive, the object of Article 9 is to reconcile two fundamental rights: the protection of privacy and freedom of
         expression. The obligation to do so lies on the Member States.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reconcile those two &#8216;fundamental rights&#8217; for the purposes of the directive, the Member States are required to
         provide for a number of derogations or limitations in relation to the protection of data and, therefore, in relation to the
         fundamental right to privacy, specified in Chapters II, IV and VI of the directive. Those derogations must be made solely
         for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression, which fall within the scope of the fundamental
         right to freedom of expression, in so far as it is apparent that they are necessary in order to reconcile the right to privacy
         with the rules governing freedom of expression. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point56">56</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic society, it is necessary,
         first, to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly. Secondly, and in order to achieve a balance
         between the two fundamental rights, the protection of the fundamental right to privacy requires that the derogations and limitations
         in relation to the protection of data provided for in the chapters of the directive referred to above must apply only in so
         far as is strictly necessary. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point57">57</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, the following points are relevant.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point58">58</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as the Advocate General pointed out at point 65 of her Opinion and as is apparent from the legislative history of the
         directive, the exemptions and derogations provided for in Article 9 of the directive apply not only to media undertakings
         but also to every person engaged in journalism.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point59">59</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the fact that the publication of data within the public domain is done for profit-making purposes does not, prima
         facie, preclude such publication being considered as an activity undertaken &#8216;solely for journalistic purposes&#8217;. As Markkinap&ouml;rssi
         and Satamedia state in their observations and as the Advocate General noted at point 82 of her Opinion, every undertaking
         will seek to generate a profit from its activities. A degree of commercial success may even be essential to professional journalistic
         activity.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point60">60</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, account must be taken of the evolution and proliferation of methods of communication and the dissemination of information.
         As was mentioned by the Swedish Government in particular, the medium which is used to transmit the processed data, whether
         it be classic in nature, such as paper or radio waves, or electronic, such as the internet, is not determinative as to whether
         an activity is undertaken &#8216;solely for journalistic purposes&#8217;. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point61">61</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from all of the above that activities such as those involved in the main proceedings, relating to data from documents
         which are in the public domain under national legislation, may be classified as &#8216;journalistic activities&#8217; if their object
         is the disclosure to the public of information, opinions or ideas, irrespective of the medium which is used to transmit them.
         They are not limited to media undertakings and may be undertaken for profit-making purposes.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point62">62</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second question should therefore be that Article 9 of the directive is to be interpreted as meaning that
         the activities referred to at points (a) to (d) of the first question, relating to data from documents which are in the public

      <P class="C02AlineaAltA">The third question</P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point63">63</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its third question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 17 of the directive should be interpreted as meaning
         that it precludes the publication of data which have been collected for journalistic purposes and their onward transfer for
         commercial purposes.

         of those parties, are not recoverable.
