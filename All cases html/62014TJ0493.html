Ms Mayer was seconded to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) from 1 July 2013 under a contract concluded on the same day between herself, EFSA and the Land Saxony (‘the contract’). In accordance with Article 5 thereof, the contract was concluded for one year, until 30 June 2014. According to Article 4 of the decision of the Executive Directive of EFSA of 18 February 2013 laying down the rules on secondment for national experts and national experts in professional training at EFSA (‘the SNE rules’), applicable to the contract, a secondment may be renewed one or several times, but the total period of the secondment may not, in principle, exceed four years.</p>

On 16 December 2013, as a result of a disagreement with the president of the Staff Committee concerning a case to be dealt with in the applicant’s absence, the Staff Committee decided to suspend her from her Staff Committee duties for six months, with immediate effect, on the ground that she had breached her duty of confidentiality.</p>

The applicant claims that during the second interview, Mr D. mentioned a request for access to documents from the network of non-governmental organisations, Pesticide Action Network Europe (PAN Europe), concerning the emails exchanged between a senior official of EFSA, Ms K., and International Life Sciences Institute (‘ILSI’), a private organisation active in the nutrition sector. The EFSA challenges that assertion.</p>

Therefore, on 24 April 2014, the applicant lodged a complaint with the Director of the EFSA, based on Article 23 of the SNE rules, against the abovementioned letter of 16 April 2014. The complaint was supplemented by observations submitted on 5 and 10 June 2014.</p>

Therefore, there was no right to renewal of the contract. Furthermore, EFSA relies on its discretion in the organisation of its services and sets out the reasons justifying its decision not to extend the contract, while, in that context, refuting certain allegations made by the applicant in various emails which had been previously sent to it by her.</p>

               <p class="normal">Second, by the same letter of 27 June 2014, EFSA refused the confirmatory request for access to the abovementioned documents based on the exception laid down in Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001. EFSA states that, where a request based on that regulation seeks access to documents containing personal data, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (<a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2001:008:TOC"
                     hreflang="en"

                     >OJ 2001 L 8, p. 1</a>) become applicable in full. Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001 requires the recipient of personal data to establish the necessity of having them transferred, by way of legitimate justifications or convincing arguments. EFSA argues that the applicant has not satisfied that requirement. Furthermore, its decision not to extend the secondment is based solely on the fact that the operational requirements of the unit to which the applicant was assigned had changed, so that her profile no longer met the necessary requirements at the time. Further, there was no connection between that decision and the emails to which the applicant wishes to have access. Finally, EFSA indicates to the applicant that she may bring an action for annulment against the two decisions contained in the letter of 27 June 2014 before the General Court pursuant to Article 263 TFEU or that she may lodge a complaint with the European Ombudsman.</p>
