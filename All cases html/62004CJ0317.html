      <P class="C04Titre1">&nbsp;<B>Background</B></P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point33">33</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States passed legislation in November 2001 providing that
         air carriers operating flights to or from the United States or across United States territory had to provide the United States
         customs authorities with electronic access to the data contained in their automated reservation and departure control systems,
         referred to as &#8216;Passenger Name Records&#8217; (&#8216;PNR data&#8217;). While acknowledging the legitimacy of the security interests at stake,
         the Commission informed the United States authorities, in June 2002, that those provisions could come into conflict with Community
         and Member State legislation on data protection and with certain provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 of 24 July
         1989 on a code of conduct for computerised reservation systems (OJ 1989 L 220, p. 1), as amended by Council Regulation (EC)
         No 323/1999 of 8 February 1999 (OJ 1999 L 40, p.&nbsp;1). The United States authorities postponed the entry into force of the new
         provisions but, ultimately, refused to waive the right to impose penalties on airlines failing to comply with the legislation
         on electronic access to PNR data after 5 March 2003. Since then, a number of large airlines in the European Union have granted
         the United States authorities access to their PNR data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point34">34</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission entered into negotiations with the United States authorities, which gave rise to a document containing undertakings
         on the part of CBP, with a view to the adoption by the Commission of a decision on adequacy pursuant to Article 25(6) of the
         Directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 13 June 2003 the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data, set up
         by Article 29 of the Directive, delivered an opinion in which it expressed doubts regarding the level of data protection guaranteed
         by those undertakings for the processing operations envisaged. It reiterated those doubts in an opinion of 29 January 2004.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point36">36</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1 March 2004 the Commission placed before the Parliament the draft decision on adequacy under Article 25(6) of the Directive,

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point37">37</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17 March 2004 the Commission submitted to the Parliament, with a view to its consultation in accordance with the first
         subparagraph of Article 300(3) EC, a proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of an agreement with the United
         States. By letter of 25 March 2004, the Council, referring to the urgent procedure, requested the Parliament to deliver an
         opinion on that proposal by 22 April 2004 at the latest. In that letter, the Council stated: &#8216;The fight against terrorism,
         which justifies the proposed measures, is a key priority of the European Union. Air carriers and passengers are at present
         in a situation of uncertainty which urgently needs to be remedied. In addition, it is essential to protect the financial interests

         setting out a number of reservations of a legal nature regarding the proposal which had been submitted to it. In particular,
         the Parliament considered that the draft decision on adequacy exceeded the powers conferred on the Commission by Article 25
         of the Directive. It called for the conclusion of an appropriate international agreement respecting fundamental rights that
         would cover a number of points set out in detail in the resolution, and asked the Commission to submit a new draft decision
         to it. It also reserved the right to refer the matter to the Court for review of the legality of the projected international
         agreement and, in particular, of its compatibility with protection of the right to privacy.

         of the Directive, relating to the exclusion of activities which fall outside the scope of Community law, was infringed.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Parliament&#8217;s submission, there is no doubt that the processing of PNR data after transfer to the United States authority
         covered by the decision on adequacy is, and will be, carried out in the course of activities of the State as referred to in
         paragraph 43 of the judgment in Case C-101/01 <I>Lindqvist</I> [2003] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;12971.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission, supported by the United Kingdom, considers that the air carriers&#8217; activities clearly fall within the scope
         of Community law. It submits that those private operators process the PNR data within the Community and arrange for their
         transfer to a third country. Activities of private parties are therefore involved, and not activities of the Member State
         in which the carriers concerned operate, or of its public authorities, as defined by the Court in paragraph 43 of <I>Lindqvist</I>. The aim pursued by the air carriers in processing PNR data is simply to comply with the requirements of Community law, including
         the obligation laid down in paragraph 2 of the Agreement. Article 3(2) of the Directive refers to activities of public authorities
         which fall outside the scope of Community law.
      </P>
      <P class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;Findings of the Court</P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first indent of Article 3(2) of the Directive excludes from the Directive&#8217;s scope the processing of personal data in the
         course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law, such as activities provided for by Titles V and VI of
         the Treaty on European Union, and in any case processing operations concerning public security, defence, State security and
         the activities of the State in areas of criminal law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision on adequacy concerns only PNR data transferred to CBP. It is apparent from the sixth recital in the preamble
         to the decision that the requirements for that transfer are based on a statute enacted by the United States in November 2001
         and on implementing regulations adopted by CBP under that statute. According to the seventh recital in the preamble, the United
         States legislation in question concerns the enhancement of security and the conditions under which persons may enter and leave
         the country. The eighth recital states that the Community is fully committed to supporting the United States in the fight
         against terrorism within the limits imposed by Community law. The 15th recital states that PNR data will be used strictly
         for purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and related crimes, other serious crimes, including organised crime, that
         are transnational in nature, and flight from warrants or custody for those crimes.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point56">56</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that the transfer of PNR data to CBP constitutes processing operations concerning public security and the activities
         of the State in areas of criminal law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point57">57</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the view may rightly be taken that PNR data are initially collected by airlines in the course of an activity which falls
         within the scope of Community law, namely sale of an aeroplane ticket which provides entitlement to a supply of services,
         the data processing which is taken into account in the decision on adequacy is, however, quite different in nature. As pointed
         out in paragraph 55 of the present judgment, that decision concerns not data processing necessary for a supply of services,
         but data processing regarded as necessary for safeguarding public security and for law-enforcement purposes.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point58">58</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court held in paragraph 43 of <I>Lindqvist</I>, which was relied upon by the Commission in its defence, that the activities mentioned by way of example in the first indent
         of Article 3(2) of the Directive are, in any event, activities of the State or of State authorities and unrelated to the fields
         of activity of individuals. However, this does not mean that, because the PNR data have been collected by private operators
         for commercial purposes and it is they who arrange for their transfer to a third country, the transfer in question is not
         covered by that provision. The transfer falls within a framework established by the public authorities that relates to public
         security. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point59">59</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the foregoing considerations that the decision on adequacy concerns processing of personal data as referred
         to in the first indent of Article 3(2) of the Directive. That decision therefore does not fall within the scope of the Directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point60">60</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the first limb of the first plea, alleging that the first indent of Article 3(2) of the Directive was infringed,

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point63">63</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament submits that Article 95 EC does not constitute an appropriate legal basis for Decision 2004/496. The decision
         does not have as its objective and subject-matter the establishment and functioning of the internal market by contributing
         to the removal of obstacles to the freedom to provide services and it does not contain provisions designed to achieve such
         an objective. Its purpose is to make lawful the processing of personal data that is required by United States legislation.
         Nor can Article 95 EC justify Community competence to conclude the Agreement, because the Agreement relates to data processing
         operations which are excluded from the scope of the Directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point64">64</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council contends that the Directive, validly adopted on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty, contains in Article 25
         provisions enabling personal data to be transferred to a third country which ensures an adequate level of protection, including
         the possibility of entering, if need be, into negotiations leading to the conclusion by the Community of an agreement with
         that country. The Agreement concerns the free movement of PNR data between the Community and the United States under conditions
         which respect the fundamental freedoms and rights of individuals, in particular privacy. It is intended to eliminate any distortion
         of competition, between the Member States&#8217; airlines and between the latter and the airlines of third countries, which may
         result from the requirements imposed by the United States, for reasons relating to the protection of individual rights and
         freedoms. The conditions of competition between Member States&#8217; airlines operating international passenger flights to and from
         the United States could have been distorted because only some of them granted the United States authorities access to their
         databases. The Agreement is designed to impose harmonised obligations on all the airlines concerned.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point65">65</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission observes that there is a &#8216;conflict of laws&#8217;, within the meaning of public international law, between the United
         States legislation and the Community rules and that it is necessary to reconcile them. It complains that the Parliament, which
         disputes that Article 95 EC can constitute the legal basis for Decision 2004/496, has not suggested an appropriate legal basis.
         According to the Commission, that article is &#8216;the natural legal basis&#8217; for the decision because the Agreement concerns the
         external dimension of the protection of personal data when transferred within the Community. Articles 25 and 26 of the Directive
         justify exclusive Community external competence.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point66">66</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Commission submits that the initial processing of the data by the airlines is carried out for commercial
         purposes. The use which the United States authorities make of the data does not remove them from the effect of the Directive.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point67">67</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 95 EC, read in conjunction with Article 25 of the Directive, cannot justify Community competence to conclude the Agreement.

         3 of the Agreement, CBP stated that it was implementing the Undertakings annexed to that decision.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point73">73</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given, first, the fact that the Community cannot rely on its own law as justification for not fulfilling the Agreement which
         remains applicable during the period of 90 days from termination thereof and, second, the close link that exists between the
         Agreement and the decision on adequacy, it appears justified, for reasons of legal certainty and in order to protect the persons
         concerned, to preserve the effect of the decision on adequacy during that same period. In addition, account should be taken
         of the period needed for the adoption of the measures necessary to comply with this judgment.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point74">74</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore appropriate to preserve the effect of the decision on adequacy until 30 September 2006, but its effect shall
