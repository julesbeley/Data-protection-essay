Further, in that ground of appeal, ClientEarth and PAN Europe do not confine themselves to repeating the arguments which they had earlier presented to the General Court against the EFSA decision of 12 December 2011, but challenge the error in law which they claim the General Court committed in its application of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001.

EFSA relied, to that end, on examples of individual attacks to which experts whose assistance it had requested were exposed.</p>

Those examples do not, however, in any way prove that the disclosure of the information at issue would have been such as to create a risk that the privacy or the integrity of the experts concerned would be undermined.</p>

On the contrary, such disclosure would, by itself, have made it possible for the suspicions of partiality in question to be dispelled or would have provided to experts who might be concerned with the opportunity to dispute, if necessary by available legal remedies, the merits of those allegations of partiality.</p>

Such an outcome would be contrary to the requirement that exceptions to the right of access to documents held by the institutions must be interpreted strictly, a requirement which entails that it must be established that there is a risk of a specific and actual adverse effect on the interest protected.</p>
