In the present case, he stressed that it was of the utmost importance for European citizens to know which MEPs had a personal interest in the additional pension scheme, having regard, principally, to the fact that the European Parliament paid two thirds of the contributions of the MEPs participating in the scheme, that it had, on several occasions, made up shortfalls in the scheme and that it had committed itself to compensating any losses suffered by the scheme, thus ensuring the preservation of the acquired pension rights of MEPs participating in the scheme, which, in the applicant’s view, translated into considerable use of public funds.</p>

Should the view be taken that disclosure of the names of the MEPs participating in the scheme would affect their private interests, the applicant’s arguments that these are not legitimate private interests since, given that the scheme was established and was influenced by elected representatives for elected representatives and pays benefits funded from public money, such private interests ought not to be treated in the same manner as those relating to private contributions into a normal pension scheme. In the applicant’s view, a negative public reaction to the membership of certain MEPs in the scheme cannot be regarded as undermining the right to privacy, which Regulation No 1049/2001 seeks to avoid.</p>

In the Secretary-General’s view, the applicant had failed to demonstrate the necessity for the data at issue to be transferred by referring exclusively to the public interest in transparency. Accordingly, he took the view that it was not necessary to examine whether there was a risk that the MEPs’ legitimate interests might be prejudiced. Lastly, as regards the fourth category of documents requested by the applicant, the Secretary-General identified the documents relating to the financial position of the additional pension scheme since 2009 and provided the references under which those documents could be found on the Parliament’s website.</p>

The applicant drew particular attention to the reasons why he considered it necessary to have the personal data at issue transferred, relying on the right of access to information and the right to freedom of expression. He noted the European Parliament’s failure to weigh the necessity for that data to be transferred against the right to privacy of the MEPs concerned, and the lack of any explanation as to how the requested access could specifically and actually have undermined the privacy of those MEPs. Next, the applicant explained in detail, on the one hand, why it was necessary for the documents requested to be disclosed, namely, in order for him to be able to report on the manner in which public money was being spent, the possible impact of private interests on the voting behaviour of the MEPs and on the functioning of control mechanisms, and, on the other hand, why any private interests of the MEPs concerned by the requested documents could not prevail over the freedom of expression and the public’s interest in being informed of how public funds were spent and political decisions taken.</p>

               <p class="normal">As regards the requirement relating to necessity laid down in Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, in the contested decision the European Parliament first considered that it had to be interpreted restrictively like any other exception to a fundamental right. Secondly, it agreed that the applicant had been very specific about his intentions concerning the personal data at issue, but stated that his arguments failed to establish the necessity of having the data transferred. The Parliament took the view that to accept as a valid argument, in the context of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, the assertion of an interest of the public and of the media in exercising control over public expenditure would be to allow the disclosure of personal data beyond any reasonable limit and would infringe the rules on the protection of such data. More specifically, the Parliament noted that the applicant had not established a link between his intentions and the specific data to which he had requested access. It was neither necessary nor proportionate to request the names of all MEPs participating in the additional pension scheme, since decisions relating to that scheme were adopted by the Bureau. Thirdly, the Parliament observed that the risk of a conflict of interest was typical of the situation of a parliament, for a parliament always decided on the remuneration of its members, a fact which could not justify per se the disclosure of personal data. Fourthly, the Parliament considered that Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001 had to be interpreted in such a way as to safeguard the rationale and effectiveness of that regulation and that it could not be applied in such a way as to render the regulation completely devoid of substance, which would be the case if, as in the present case, the sole purpose of the transfer of personal data was the immediate disclosure of the data to the public. However, because the application of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001 requires the person requesting the transfer to demonstrate the necessity for the personal data to be transferred, the aim pursued by the applicant would enable persons who had not demonstrated any such necessity to have access to those data, contrary to the rule laid down in the judgment in <span class="italic">Commission</span> v <span class="italic">Bavarian Lager</span>, cited in paragraph 4 above (<a href="./../../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A378&lang=EN&format=pdf&target=null"

               <p class="normal">As regards the weighing up of the necessity of transferring the personal data at issue against the legitimate interests of the data subjects, the European Parliament considered, in the light of Regulation No 45/2001, that those legitimate interests prevailed, on the ground that it would not be proportionate to allow such a transfer. First, the Parliament accepted that MEPs’ legitimate interests were less far-reaching than those of a private person without any public commitment and that, therefore, the degree of protection of their data was lower. Secondly, the Parliament nevertheless pointed out that the public funding of the additional pension scheme did not mean that the MEPs’ personal data should not be afforded any protection or that those MEPs would have no legitimate interests in arguing against disclosure of such data. In that context, the Parliament explained that it was necessary to draw a distinction between data falling into the public sphere, subject to a lower degree of protection, and data falling into the private sphere, protected by the concept of legitimate interests. In the Parliament’s view, the personal data at issue fell into the MEPs’ private sphere, the information those data contained constituting a legitimate interest that was required to be protected. The data related to the personal financial situation of the MEPs concerned, namely contributions into a pension scheme and pension rights under that scheme, which were private concerns. The Parliament noted that while the existence of a parliamentary mandate was the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for gaining access to the scheme, the pension was paid only after the end of the mandate and that the personal contributions were significant. Thirdly, the Parliament argued that, if public funding were sufficient to deny the personal character of the data, then the same would also have to apply to any member of staff of a public authority. Fourthly, the Parliament concluded in the weighing up of the interests that, given, in particular, the general nature of the interest of the media and the general public in the personal situation of MEPs, it was not proportionate to disclose the data requested, unless it were to be accepted that it should be possible to gain access to all personal data of MEPs or of any public officials involving public expenditure. In the Parliament’s view, such an approach would render Article 16 TFEU entirely meaningless, when, in order to achieve his goals, the applicant could have merely requested the aggregated figures concerning the financial situation of the scheme. Fifthly, the Parliament noted that there were more appropriate measures for achieving the goals pursued by the applicant, which ensured sufficient control of public expenditure and informed the public.</p>

Secondly, the applicant takes the view that the European Parliament failed to establish in the contested decision that the MEPs’ legitimate interests would be prejudiced by disclosure of the requested documents. By his third claim, he asserts that even if the Parliament had rightly considered that the requested information fell within the MEPs’ private sphere, that would not be sufficient to protect it as a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, which requires a weighing up of the interests engaged.</p>

Furthermore, in its statement in intervention, the Republic of Finland states that the core content and fundamental principles of both regulations must be applied so that each is applied in a manner compatible and consistent with the other. As regards those principles, it is necessary, in its view, to take account in particular of the rule laid down by Regulation No 1049/2001 concerning the lack of justification for applications for access to documents. In that context, the concept of the necessity of having personal data transferred, as provided for in Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, cannot be interpreted strictly, as that would restrict or remove altogether any possibility of access to documents where the application is based on a public interest such as the right to information.</p>

Such an interpretation does not have the effect of creating a categorical exception for personal data to the principle of access to documents, but of reconciling two fundamental yet opposing rights where an application for access to documents relates to personal data, protected by Regulation No 45/2001, as is evident from paragraphs 56 to 59 above. In the relationship between the provisions protecting those opposing rights, the right of access to documents is also preserved, since the mandatory application, as in this case, of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001 merely results, first, in the applicant being required to establish the necessity of obtaining the transfer of personal data, that is to say, to prove that the measure concerned is proportionate and the most appropriate means of attaining the aim pursued (see, to that effect, judgment in <span class="italic">Dennekamp</span> v <span class="italic">Parliament</span>, cited in paragraph 4 above, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AT%3A2011%3A688&lang=EN&format=pdf&target=null"

With that aim in mind, he indicated that it was essential for the purpose of his report to know the names of the MEPs concerned, in order to exercise his freedom of expression and to communicate that information to the public which, as citizens and taxpayers, had an interest in it. According to him, the disclosure of the names of the MEPs participating in the additional pension scheme would ensure that they could not use their votes to influence the scheme so as to benefit from it in a manner that would not accord with the wishes of their voters. According to the applicant, there is no other way for the public to find out how MEPs have exercised their public powers with regard to the scheme.</p>

               <p class="normal">In the contested decision, the European Parliament found, principally, that the applicant had not established the necessity of having the personal data transferred, relying on two separate grounds in order to reject the reasons put forward. First, the Parliament identified the interest of the public and the media in the expenditure of public money, which includes the financial benefits enjoyed by MEPs, as constituting one justification for the application in the context of the freedom of information and the freedom of expression. On that point, it took the view that the public interest asserted was abstract and very general, and that if this argument were a valid argument in the context of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, it would allow for the disclosure of personal data beyond any reasonable limit, and would result in a situation that would not be in line with EU rules on data protection. Secondly, the Parliament stated that the applicant had failed to provide a link between his aims and the specific personal data he had requested to be transferred, the reasons why the transfer was necessary being unclear. It went on to note that, in order to exercise public control, it was neither necessary nor proportionate to request the names of all members of the additional pension scheme as decisions on that scheme were adopted by the Bureau, and pointed out that the applicant should have identified a particular and specific risk of conflict of interest in order to prove the necessity of the data transfer.</p>

It observes that that interpretation of ‘necessity’ is consistent with Article 15 TEU and with Regulation No 1049/2001. This is, <span class="italic">a fortiori</span>, the case when, as in this instance, the purpose of the application for the transfer of personal data is the disclosure of the data to the public, which constitutes maximum interference with the right to protection of the data. In the Parliament’s view, Regulation No 45/2001 is not designed to enable disclosure <span class="italic">erga omnes</span>, but to allow the exclusive transfer of personal data to specific recipients. Furthermore, it notes that the applicant did not, prior to the adoption of the contested decision, provide any argument objectively substantiating the alleged public interest, in particular as to the existence, currently, of a public debate on the additional pension scheme or the questionable behaviour of an MEP, as envisaged by the judgment in <span class="italic">Dennekamp</span> v <span class="italic">Parliament</span>, cited in paragraph 4 above (<a href="./../../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AT%3A2011%3A688&lang=EN&format=pdf&target=null"

However, it is apparent from the provisions of Article 76(d), in conjunction with Article 84(1), of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court that the application initiating proceedings must state the subject-matter of the proceedings and contain a summary of the pleas in law relied on, and that no new plea in law or argument may be introduced in the course of proceedings unless it is based on matters of law or of fact which come to light in the course of the procedure (judgment of 21 October 2010 in <span class="italic">Umbach</span> v <span class="italic">Commission</span>, T‑474/08, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AT%3A2010%3A443&lang=EN&format=pdf&target=null"

It must be noted that it cannot be determined from those points in what respect the transfer of the names of MEPs participating in the scheme is the most appropriate measure for attaining the applicant’s objective, or how it is proportionate to that objective.

Therefore, that argument must in any event be rejected as having no factual basis, since none of the reasons given for the contested decision includes any such assertion.</p>

In the present case, the potential conflict of interest lies in the fact that, by voting, MEPs can amend the additional pension scheme or express their views on it in such a way as to promote their interests as beneficiaries of the scheme.</p>

               <p class="normal">In order to be in a position to bring to light potential conflicts of interest of MEPs when they are deciding on the additional pension scheme, it is necessary to know the names of those who are members of the scheme, without the fact that the conflict of interest in question is, as the European Parliament contends, inherent in the duties of members of an elected assembly having any influence on the assessment of the necessity of having the personal data transferred. In itself, that fact cannot in any way establish that the envisaged transfer is not necessary. Such a transfer is therefore the only measure by which the applicant’s aim can be attained, no other measure being capable of ensuring that MEPs facing a potential conflict of interest are identified. Consequently, it must be concluded, for the purpose of applying Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, that the transfer of the names of MEPs participating in the scheme is the most appropriate measure and that it is proportionate for the purpose of determining whether the interests that MEPs have in the scheme can influence their voting behaviour (see, to that effect, judgment in <span class="italic">Dennekamp</span> v <span class="italic">Parliament</span>, cited in paragraph 4 above, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AT%3A2011%3A688&lang=EN&format=pdf&target=null"

It is also necessary to determine which of the MEPs have been called upon to decide on the scheme in a vote, since the European Parliament maintains that only MEPs who are members of the scheme and of the Bureau — the body which, according to the Parliament, takes decisions on the management of the scheme — could find themselves in a situation in which there is a potential conflict of interest.</p>

Furthermore, the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is not aimed only at revealing those cases in which the public official has performed his duties with the intention of satisfying his private interests, but also at informing the public of the risks of public officials being subject to conflicts of interest, so that they act impartially in the performance of their official duties, after, in view of the circumstances in which they find themselves, having declared the potential conflict of interest to which they are subject and taken or proposed measures to resolve or avoid that conflict.

The concept of a conflict of interest relates to a situation in which the interest identified may, in the eyes of the public, appear to influence the impartial and objective performance of official duties (see paragraph 106 above) and does not, therefore, require the lack of any impartial performance of the duties in question to be demonstrated. More specifically, the applicant cannot be criticised for not having himself identified the body within the Parliament that was required to decide on the scheme, and thus the group of MEPs concerned, before requesting that the names of the relevant MEPs be transferred.</p>

There is nothing in Regulation No 1049/2001 to require an applicant for access to the documents held by an institution or body of the European Union to adopt that approach, nor can it be inferred from the application of Regulation No 45/2001 with respect to documents containing personal data.</p>

It would be entirely inappropriate for an application for the transfer of personal data to be assessed in the same way irrespective of the identity of the data subject. Public figures have chosen to expose themselves to scrutiny by third parties, particularly the media and, through them, by a lesser or greater general public depending on the policy area, even if such a choice in no way implies that their legitimate interests must be regarded as never being prejudiced by a decision to transfer data relating to them. Thus, public figures have generally already accepted that some of their personal data will be disclosed to the public, and may even have encouraged or made such disclosure themselves. It is necessary therefore to take that environment into account when assessing the risk of the legitimate interests of public figures being prejudiced in the context of the application of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, and in weighing those interests against the necessity of transferring the personal data requested.</p>

The possibility of being a member of the scheme is open only to MEPs. Thus, having a mandate as a Member of the European Parliament is the first condition and is necessary in order to benefit from the additional pension provided under the scheme. For that principal reason, the personal data at issue fall into the public sphere of MEPs.</p>

It is also necessary to take into consideration not only the link with the MEP’s mandate, but also all the information given by the applicant (not disputed by the European Parliament and indeed confirmed by the contents of the case-file) concerning the operation of the scheme, namely the Parliament’s funding of two thirds of the contributions paid, the fact that it makes up shortfalls in the scheme and its commitment to compensating any losses suffered by the scheme, which, according to the applicant, thus ensures the preservation of the acquired pension rights of MEPs who are members of the scheme.

Nothing in the wording of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001 militates in favour of such a presumption being recognised, since the assessment of an application for personal data to be transferred requires the interests engaged to be weighed up after the applicant has established that there is a necessity for the data to be transferred (see, to that effect, judgments in <span class="italic">Commission</span> v <span class="italic">Bavarian Lager</span>, cited in paragraph 4 above, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/redirect/?urn=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A378&lang=EN&format=pdf&target=null"

Moreover, the Parliament wrongly relies on Regulation No 1049/2001 in order to justify the existence of such a presumption, noting that the regulation permits exceptions to the right to transparency. While Regulation No 1049/2001 does indeed provide for an exception to the right of access to documents where disclosure would risk undermining the privacy or the integrity of the individual, thus making Regulation No 45/2001 applicable, that does not have the effect of creating a presumption in favour of the legitimate interests of persons whose personal data are protected by the latter regulation.</p>

The same applies in respect of the argument concerning the fact that MEPs might attract criticism from the public in relation to an alleged conflict of interest. Since such a conflict is inherent in the function of Member of the European Parliament, any criticisms may already be made by any member of the public familiar with the issues concerning the scheme, even if that person is not precisely aware of the names of MEPs potentially affected by such a conflict of interest.

According to the Parliament, pension contributions and the resulting pension rights are always private concerns, and the link with the MEP’s mandate or the method of funding the additional pension scheme has no relevance. The Parliament went on to find that, if that were not the case, the applicant’s proposition would apply to any member of staff of a public authority. It reiterated its view that the transfer of the data at issue, which is based on the general interest of the media and the general public in the personal financial situation of MEPs, was not proportionate, as, if it were otherwise, the media and the public would have access to all the private data of MEPs and of public officials involving public expenditure. It disputed the applicant’s argument that the disclosure of the documents requested would be more appropriate than the measures designed to provide public control of public expenditure.
