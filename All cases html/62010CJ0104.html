      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point1">1.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4(1) of Directive 97/80 on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex must be interpreted as meaning
         that it does not entitle an applicant for vocational training, who believes that his application was not accepted because
         of an infringement of the principle of equal treatment, to information held by the course provider on the qualifications of
         the other applicants for the course in question, in order that he may establish &#8216;facts from which it may be presumed that
         there has been direct or indirect discrimination&#8217; in accordance with that provision.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that a refusal of disclosure by a defendant, in the context of establishing such facts,
         could risk compromising the achievement of the objective pursued by that directive and thus depriving, in particular, Article
         4(1) thereof of its effectiveness. It is for the national court to ascertain whether that is the case in the main proceedings.

      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point2">2.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4 of Directive 76/207 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access
         to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions and Article 1(3) of Directive 2002/73, amending Directive
         76/207, must be interpreted as meaning that they do not entitle an applicant for vocational training to information held by
         the course provider on the qualifications of the other applicants for the course in question, either because he believes that
         he has been denied access to vocational training on the basis of the same criteria as the other candidates and discriminated
         against on grounds of sex, referred to in Article 4 of Directive 76/207, or because that applicant complains that he was discriminated
         against on the grounds of sex, referred to in Article 1(3) of Directive 2002/73, with regard to access to that vocational
         training.

      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point3">3.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an applicant for vocational training can rely on Directive 97/80 on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based
         on sex in order to obtain access to information held by the course provider on the qualifications of the other applicants
         for the course in question, that entitlement to access can be affected by rules of Union law relating to confidentiality.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Thus, in assessing whether a refusal of disclosure by a defendant, in the context of establishing facts which permit a presumption
         that there has been discrimination, could risk compromising the achievement of the objective pursued by Directive 97/80 and
         thus depriving Article 4(1) thereof in particular of its effectiveness, national courts or other competent bodies must take
         into account the rules governing confidentiality which follow from measures of Union law, such as Directive 95/46 on the protection
         of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Directive 2002/58
         concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive
         on privacy and electronic communications). The protection of personal data is also provided for in Article 8 of the Charter
         of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point4">4.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligation laid down in the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU does not differ according to whether a Member State has
         an adversarial or an inquisitorial legal system.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Article 267 TFEU confers on national courts the power and, in certain circumstances, an obligation, to make a reference to
         the Court once the national court considers, either of its own motion or at the request of the parties, that the substance
         of the dispute involves a question which falls within the scope of the first paragraph of that article. It follows that the
         national courts have the most extensive power to make a reference to the Court if they consider that a case pending before
         them raises issues involving an interpretation or assessment of the validity of provisions of Union law requiring a decision
         by them.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Moreover, the system of references for a preliminary ruling is based on a dialogue between one court and another, the initiation
         of which depends entirely on the national court&#8217;s assessment as to whether a reference is appropriate and necessary. Thus,
         not only is it for the national court to assess whether an interpretation of Union law is necessary to enable it to resolve
         the dispute before it, having regard to the procedural mechanism laid down in Article 267 TFEU, but it is also for that court
         to decide the manner in which those questions are to be worded. Although that court is at liberty to request the parties to
         the dispute before it to suggest wording suitable for the questions to be referred, the fact remains that it is finally for
         the court alone to decide both the form and the content of those questions.

         of the principle of equal treatment, to information held by the course provider on the qualifications of the other applicants
         for the course in question, in order that he may establish &#8216;facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point27">27</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kelly submits that under Article 4(1) of Directive 97/80 persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle
         of equal treatment has not been applied to them are entitled to information that would, if that principle has wrongly not
         been applied to them, establish, or assist in establishing, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which
         it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination. For applicants for a course of vocational training
         who consider themselves wronged because that principle has not been applied to them, this includes information on the qualifications
         of the other applicants. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point28">28</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The German Government contends that there is nothing in the wording of Article 4(1) of Directive 97/80 to indicate the grant
         of a right to disclosure. UCD and the Commission share its view that that provision sets out the conditions in which the burden
         of proof is shifted from the claimant to the respondent. According to those parties, that shift occurs only where a candidate
         has already established facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination. 
      </P>
      <P class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;Findings of the Court</P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point29">29</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directive 97/80 provides in Article 4(1) that the Member States are to take such measures as are necessary to ensure that,
         when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish,
         before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination,
         it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of that principle (see Case C&#8209;196/02 <I>Nikoloudi</I> [2005] ECR I&#8209;1789, paragraph 68). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point30">30</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it is the person who considers himself to have been wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied
         to him who must initially establish the facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination.
         It is only where that person has established such facts that it is then for the defendant to prove that there has been no
         breach of the principle of non-discrimination. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point31">31</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it is apparent from recital 13 in the preamble to Directive 97/80 that the appreciation of the facts from
         which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination is a matter for national judicial or other
         competent bodies, in accordance with national law or practice.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point32">32</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence, it is for the national court or some other competent Irish body to assess, in accordance with Irish law and/or
         national practice, whether Mr Kelly has established the facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or
         indirect discrimination. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point33">33</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, it must be stated that Directive 97/80, pursuant to Article 1 thereof, seeks to ensure that the measures taken
         by the Member States to implement the principle of equal treatment are made more effective, in order to enable all persons
         who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them to have their rights
         asserted by judicial process after possible recourse to other competent bodies. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point34">34</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, although Article 4(1) of that directive does not specifically entitle persons who consider themselves wronged because

         from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination&#8217; in accordance with that provision, the
         fact remains that it cannot be excluded that a refusal of disclosure by the defendant, in the context of establishing such
         facts, could risk compromising the achievement of the objective pursued by that directive and thus depriving that provision
         in particular of its effectiveness. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it must be borne in mind that Member States may not apply rules which are liable to jeopardise the achievement

         by the requirement of giving European Union law its full effect within the framework of the judicial systems of the Member
         States (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/09 [2011] ECR I&#8209;0000, paragraph 83 and the case-law cited).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point61">61</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 267 TFEU confers on national courts the power and, in certain circumstances, an obligation, to make a reference to
         the Court once the national court considers, either of its own motion or at the request of the parties, that the substance
         of the dispute involves a question which falls within the scope of the first paragraph of that article. It follows that the
         national courts have the most extensive power to make a reference to the Court if they consider that a case pending before
         them raises issues involving an interpretation or assessment of the validity of provisions of European Union law and requiring
         a decision by them (see, inter alia, Case C&#8209;210/06 <I>Cartesio</I> [2008] ECR I&#8209;9641, paragraph 88, and Joined Cases C&#8209;188/10 and C&#8209;189/10 <I>Melki and Abdeli</I> [2010] ECR I&#8209;0000, paragraph 41). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point62">62</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Court has already held that the system established by Article&nbsp;267 TFEU with a view to ensuring that European
         Union law is interpreted uniformly throughout the Member States institutes direct cooperation between the Court of Justice
         and the national courts by means of a procedure which is completely independent of any initiative by the parties (see, inter
         alia, <I>Cartesio</I>, paragraph 90). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point63">63</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, the system of references for a preliminary ruling is based on a dialogue between one court and another, the
         initiation of which depends entirely on the national court&#8217;s assessment as to whether a reference is appropriate and necessary
         (<I>Cartesio</I>, paragraph 91). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point64">64</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, not only is it for the national court to assess whether an interpretation of European Union law is necessary to enable
         it to resolve the dispute before it, having regard to the procedural mechanism laid down in Article 267 TFEU, but it is also
         for that court to decide the manner in which those questions are to be worded. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point65">65</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although that court is at liberty to request the parties to the dispute before it to suggest wording suitable for the question
         to be referred, the fact remains that it is for it alone ultimately to decide both its form and content.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point66">66</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, the answer to the fourth question is that the obligation contained in the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU
         does not differ according to whether a Member State has an adversarial or an inquisitorial legal system.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point67">67</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court,
         the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs
         of those parties, are not recoverable.

      <P class="C41DispositifIntroduction">On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules:</P>

            sex must be interpreted as meaning that it does not entitle an applicant for vocational training, who believes that his application
            was not accepted because of an infringement of the principle of equal treatment, to information held by the course provider
            on the qualifications of the other applicants for the course in question, in order that he may establish &#8216;facts from which
            it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination&#8217; in accordance with that provision. </B></P>
      <P class="C32Dispositifmarge1"><B>Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that a refusal of disclosure by the defendant, in the context of establishing such facts,
            could risk compromising the achievement of the objective pursued by that directive and thus depriving Article 4(1) thereof
            in particular of its effectiveness. It is for the national court to ascertain whether that is the case in the main proceedings.

      <P class="C08Dispositif">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Article 4 of Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for
            men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions and Article 1(3)
            of Directive 2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 amending Directive 76/207 must
            be interpreted as meaning that they do not entitle an applicant for vocational training to information held by the course
            provider on the qualifications of the other applicants for the course in question, either because he believes that he has
            been denied access to vocational training on the basis of the same criteria as the other candidates and discriminated against
            on grounds of sex, referred to in Article 4 of Directive 76/207, or because that applicant complains that he was discriminated
            against on the grounds of sex, referred to in Article 1(3) of Directive 2002/73, in terms of accessing that vocational training.
