      <P class="S40Titre">Summary of the Judgment</P>
      <P class="S33MotCle"><I>Acts of the institutions &#8211; Choice of legal basis</I></P>
      <P class="S34MotCleFin"><I>(Art. 95 EC; European Parliament and Council Directive 2006/24)</I></P>
      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">Directive 2006/24/EC on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available
         electronic communications services or of public communications networks had to be adopted on the basis of Article 95 EC.
      </P>
      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">The Community legislature may have recourse to Article 95 EC in particular where disparities exist between national rules
         which are such as to obstruct the fundamental freedoms or to create distortions of competition and thus have a direct effect
         on the functioning of the internal market.
      </P>
      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">It is apparent that the differences between the various national rules adopted on the retention of data relating to electronic
         communications were liable to have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market and that it was foreseeable that
         that impact would become more serious with the passage of time. Such a situation justified the Community legislature in pursuing
         the objective of safeguarding the proper functioning of the internal market through the adoption of harmonised rules. 
      </P>
      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">Furthermore, Directive 2006/24 regulates operations which are independent of the implementation of any police and judicial
         cooperation in criminal matters. It harmonises neither the issue of access to data by the competent national law-enforcement
         authorities nor that relating to the use and exchange of those data between those authorities. Those matters, which fall,
         in principle, within the area covered by Title VI of the EU Treaty, have been excluded from the provisions of that directive.
         It follows that the substantive content of Directive 2006/24 is directed essentially at the activities of service providers
         in the relevant sector of the internal market, to the exclusion of State activities coming under Title VI of the EU Treaty.
         In light of that substantive content, it must be held that that directive relates predominantly to the functioning of the
         internal market.

      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">&#8216;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Member States have adopted legislation providing for the retention of data by service providers for the prevention,
         investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences. Those national provisions vary considerably.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal and technical differences between national provisions concerning the retention of data for the purpose of prevention,
         investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences present obstacles to the internal market for electronic communications,
         since service providers are faced with different requirements regarding the types of traffic and location data to be retained
         and the conditions and periods of retention.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 19&nbsp;December 2002 underline that, because of the significant growth
         in the possibilities afforded by electronic communications, data relating to the use of electronic communications are particularly
         important and therefore a valuable tool in the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences,
         in particular organised crime.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Declaration on Combating Terrorism adopted by the European Council on 25 March 2004 instructed the Council to examine
         measures for establishing rules on the retention of communications traffic data by service providers.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">(9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), everyone has
         the right to respect for his private life and his correspondence. Public authorities may interfere with the exercise of that
         right only in accordance with the law and where necessary in a democratic society, inter alia, in the interests of national
         security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
         Because retention of data has proved to be such a necessary and effective investigative tool for law enforcement in several
         Member States, and in particular concerning serious matters such as organised crime and terrorism, it is necessary to ensure
         that retained data are made available to law enforcement authorities for a certain period, subject to the conditions provided
         for in this Directive. The adoption of an instrument on data retention that complies with the requirements of Article 8 of
         the ECHR is therefore a necessary measure.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">(10) On 13 July 2005, the Council reaffirmed in its declaration condemning the terrorist attacks on London the need to adopt
         common measures on the retention of telecommunications data as soon as possible.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">(11) Given the importance of traffic and location data for the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences,
         as demonstrated by research and the practical experience of several Member States, there is a need to ensure at European level
         that data that are generated or processed, in the course of the supply of communications services, by providers of publicly
         available electronic communications services or of a public communications network are retained for a certain period, subject
         to the conditions provided for in this Directive. &#8217;

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point18">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28 April 2004, the French Republic, Ireland, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
         Ireland submitted to the Council of the European Union a proposal for a framework decision to be adopted on the basis of Articles
         31(1)(c) EU and 34(2)(b) EU. The subject of that proposal was the retention of data processed and stored in connection with
         the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or data in public communication networks for the purposes
         of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism (Council Document 8958/04).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point19">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission of the European Communities stated that it favoured the legal basis used in that proposed framework decision
         with respect to a part of it. In particular, it pointed out that Article 47 EU did not allow an instrument based on the EU
         Treaty to affect the <I>acquis communautaire</I>, in this case Directives 95/46 and 2002/58. Taking the view that the determination of the categories of data to be retained
         and of the relevant retention period fell within the competence of the Community legislature, the Commission reserved the
         right to submit a proposal for a directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point20">20</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21 September 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal, based on Article 95&nbsp;EC, for a directive of the European Parliament

         services and amending Directive 2002/58 [COM(2005) 438 final].

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point28">28</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland submits that the choice of Article 95 EC as the legal basis for Directive 2006/24 is a fundamental error. Neither
         Article 95 EC nor any other provision of the EC Treaty is, in its view, capable of providing an appropriate legal basis for
         that directive. Ireland argues principally that the sole objective or, at least, the main or predominant objective of that
         directive is to facilitate the investigation, detection and prosecution of crime, including terrorism. Therefore, the only
         legal basis on which the measures contained in Directive 2006/24 may be validly based is Title VI of the EU Treaty, in particular
         Articles 30 EU, 31(1)(c) EU and 34(2)(b) EU.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point29">29</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland argues that an examination of, in particular, recitals 7 to 11 and 21 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24 and of
         the fundamental provisions laid down therein, in particular Article 1(1) thereof, shows that reliance on Article 95 EC as
         the legal basis for that directive is inappropriate and unjustifiable. That directive, it contends, is clearly directed towards
         the fight against crime.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point30">30</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland submits that measures based on Article 95 EC must have as their &#8216;centre of gravity&#8217; the harmonisation of national
         laws in order to improve the functioning of the internal market (see, inter alia, Joined Cases C&#8209;317/04 and C-318/04 <I>Parliament</I> v <I>Council and Commission</I> [2006] ECR I&#8209;4721). The provisions of Directive 2006/24 concern the fight against crime and are not intended to address defects
         in the internal market.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point31">31</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, contrary to its main argument, the Court were to hold that Directive 2006/24 is indeed intended, inter alia, to prevent
         distortions or obstacles to the internal market, Ireland submits in the alternative that that objective must be regarded as
         being purely incidental to the main or predominant objective of combating crime.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point32">32</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland adds that Directive 2002/58 could be amended by another directive, but the Community legislature is not competent
         to use an amending directive adopted on the basis of Article 95 EC in order to incorporate into Directive 2002/58 provisions
         falling outside the competence conferred on the Community under the first pillar. The obligations designed to ensure that
         data are available for the investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences fall within an area which may only
         be the subject of a measure based on Title VI of the EU Treaty. The adoption of such an instrument would not affect the provisions
         of Directive 2002/58 within the meaning of Article 47 EU. If the verb &#8216;affect&#8217;, which is used in that article, were to be
         properly construed, it would be necessary to interpret it as not precluding a random or incidental overlap of unimportant
         and secondary subject matter between instruments of the Community and those of the Union.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point33">33</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Slovak Republic supports Ireland&#8217;s position. It takes the view that Article 95&nbsp;EC cannot serve as the legal basis for
         Directive 2006/24, since the latter&#8217;s main objective is not to eliminate barriers and distortions in the internal market.
         The directive&#8217;s purpose, it submits, is to harmonise the retention of personal data in a manner which goes beyond commercial
         objectives in order to facilitate action by the Member States in the area of criminal law and, for that reason, it cannot
         be adopted under Community competence.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point34">34</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Slovak Republic, the retention of personal data to the extent required by Directive 2006/24 amounts to an
         extensive interference in the right of individuals to privacy as provided for by Article 8 of the ECHR. It is questionable
         whether such far-reaching interference may be justified on economic grounds, in this case the enhanced functioning of the
         internal market. The adoption of an act outside the scope of Community competence, the primary and undisguised purpose of
         which is the fight against crime and terrorism, would be a more appropriate solution, providing a more proportionate justification
         for interference with the right of individuals to protection of their privacy.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament submits that Ireland is being selective in its interpretation of the provisions of Directive 2006/24. Recitals
         5 and 6 in the preamble thereto, it argues, make it clear that the main or predominant purpose of that directive is to eliminate
         obstacles to the internal market for electronic communications services, while recital 25 confirms that the access to and
         use of the retained data for law-enforcement purposes fall outside the scope of Community competence.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point36">36</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament submits that, following the terrorist attacks of 11&nbsp;September 2001 in New York (United States), 11 March 2004
         in Madrid (Spain) and 7 July 2005 in London (United Kingdom), a number of Member States adopted divergent rules on the retention
         of data. Such differences were liable to impede the provision of electronic communications services. The Parliament takes
         the view that the retention of data constitutes a significant cost element for the providers of publicly available electronic
         communications services or of public communications networks (&#8216;service providers&#8217;) and the existence of different requirements
         in that field may distort competition within the internal market. It adds that the main purpose of Directive 2006/24 is to
         harmonise the obligations imposed by the Member States on service providers in regard to data retention. It follows that Article
         95 EC is the correct legal basis for that directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point37">37</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament also argues that reliance on Article 95 EC as the legal basis is not invalidated by the importance attributed
         to combating crime. While crime prevention has clearly influenced the choices made in Directive 2006/24, that concern does
         not invalidate the choice of Article 95 EC as the legal basis for that directive.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point38">38</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Article 4 of Directive 2006/24 provides, in a manner consistent with the view expressed in recital 25 in the
         preamble thereto, that the conditions for access to and processing of retained data must be defined by the Member States subject
         to the legal provisions of the Union and international law, in particular the ECHR. That approach differs from that adopted
         for the measures which were the subject of the judgment in <I>Parliament</I> v <I>Council and Commission</I>, a case in which airline companies were obliged to grant access to passenger data to a law-enforcement authority in a non-member
         country. Directive 2006/24 thus respects the separation of areas of competence between the first and third pillars.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point39">39</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Parliament, although the retention of an individual&#8217;s personal data may in principle constitute interference
         within the meaning of Article 8 of the ECHR, that interference may be justified, in terms of that article, by reference to
         public safety and crime prevention. The issue of justification for such interference must be distinguished from that of the
         correct choice of the legal basis within the legal system of the Union, that being an unrelated matter.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point40">40</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council submits that, in the years following the adoption of Directive 2002/58, national law-enforcement authorities were
         becoming increasingly concerned about the exploitation of developments in the area of electronic communications for the purpose
         of committing criminal acts. Those new concerns led the Member States to adopt measures to prevent data relating to those
         communications from being erased and to ensure that they were available to law-enforcement authorities. Those measures, the
         Council continues, were divergent and began to affect the proper functioning of the internal market. Recitals 5 and 6 in the
         preamble to Directive 2006/24 are explicit in that regard.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point41">41</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That situation obliged the Community legislature to ensure that uniform rules were imposed on service providers with regard
         to the conditions under which they carried out their activities.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons, during 2006 the Community legislature considered it necessary to put an end to the obligation to erase
         data imposed by Articles 5, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58 and to provide that, in future, the data referred to in Article 5
         of Directive 2006/24 would have to be retained for a certain period. That amendment obliges the Member States to ensure that
         such data are retained for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of two years from the date of the communication. The
         purpose of that amendment was to establish precise and harmonised conditions with which service providers must comply in respect
         of the erasure or non-erasure of the personal data referred to in Article 5 of Directive 2006/24 by thus introducing common
         rules in the Community with a view to ensuring the unity of the internal market.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council takes the view that, while the need to combat crime, including terrorism, was a determining factor in the decision
         to amend the scope of the rights and obligations laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 9 of Directive 2002/58, that circumstance
         did not prevent Directive 2006/24 from having to be adopted on the basis of Article 95 EC.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point44">44</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither Articles 30 EU, 31 EU and 34 EU nor any other article in the EU Treaty can serve as the basis for a measure which,
         in substance, has the objective of amending the conditions under which service providers carry out their activities or of
         making the system established by Directive 2002/58 inapplicable to them.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules relating to the categories of data to be retained by service providers and the retention period for those data which
         amend the obligations imposed on the latter by Directive 2002/58 cannot be the subject of an instrument based on Title VI
         of the EU Treaty. The adoption of such an instrument would affect the provisions of that directive, in breach of Article 47
         EU.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Council, the rights protected by Article 8 of the ECHR are not absolute and may be subject to restrictions
         under the conditions laid down in Article 8(2) thereof. As provided in Directive 2006/24, the retention of data serves a legitimate
         public interest, recognised in Article 8(2) of the ECHR, and constitutes an appropriate means by which to protect that interest.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Spain and the Kingdom of the Netherlands submit that, as is apparent from recitals 1, 2, 5 and 6 in the preamble
         to Directive 2006/24, the main purpose of that directive is to eliminate obstacles to the internal market generated by existing
         legal and technical differences between the national provisions of the Member States. That directive, in their view, regulates
         the retention of data with the aim of eliminating that type of obstacles, first, by harmonising the obligation to retain data
         and, second, by specifying the criteria relevant to that obligation, such as the categories of data to be retained and the
         retention period.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that, under Article 1, Directive 2006/24 effects such harmonisation &#8216;in order to ensure that the data are available
         for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, as defined by each Member State in its national
         law&#8217; is a separate matter. Directive 2006/24 does not regulate the processing of data by the public or law-enforcement authorities
         of the Member States. On the contrary, that harmonisation relates only to the aspects of data retention which directly affect
         the commercial activities of service providers.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as Directive 2006/24 amends Directive 2002/58 and has a connection with Directive 95/46, the amendments which it
         contains may be properly implemented only by means of a Community instrument and not by an instrument based on the EU Treaty.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recalls that, prior to the adoption of Directive 2006/24, several Member States had adopted national measures
         on data retention pursuant to Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58. It highlights the significant divergences which existed
         between those measures. For example, the retention periods varied from three months in the Netherlands to four years in Ireland.
         The obligations relating to data retention have significant economic implications for service providers. Divergences between
         those obligations could lead to distortions in the internal market. In that context, it was legitimate to adopt Directive
         2006/24 on the basis of Article 95&nbsp;EC.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Directive 2006/24 limits, in a manner harmonised at Community level, the obligations laid down by Directive 2002/58.
         Since the latter was based on Article 95 EC, the legal basis of Directive 2006/24 cannot be different.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference to the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime in Article 1(1) of Directive 2006/24 falls
         under Community law because it serves to indicate the legitimate objective of the restrictions imposed by that directive on
         the rights of individuals with regard to data protection. Such an indication is necessary in order to comply both with the
         requirements of Directives 95/46 and 2002/58 and with those of Article 8 of the ECHR.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European Data Protection Supervisor submits that the subject-matter of Directive 2006/24 is covered by Article 95 EC because,
         first, that directive has a direct impact on the economic activities of service providers and may therefore contribute to
         the establishment and functioning of the internal market and, second, had the Community legislature not intervened, a distortion
         of competition in the internal market might have occurred. The aim of combating crime is not the sole, or even the predominant,
         objective of that directive. On the contrary, it was intended in the first place to contribute to the establishment and functioning
         of the internal market and to the elimination of distortions of competition. The directive harmonises the national provisions
         on the retention by private undertakings of certain data in the course of their normal economic activities.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Directive 2006/24 amends Directive 2002/58, which was adopted on the basis of Article 95 EC, and ought for that
         reason to be adopted on the same legal basis. Under Article 47 EU, the Community legislature alone is competent to amend obligations
         arising from a directive based on the EC Treaty.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the European Data Protection Supervisor, if the EC Treaty could not serve as the basis for Directive 2006/24,
         the provisions of Community law relating to data protection would not protect citizens in cases where the processing of their
         personal data would facilitate crime prevention. In such a situation, the general system of data protection under Community
         law would apply to data-processing for commercial purposes but not to the processing of those data for purposes of crime prevention.
         That would give rise to difficult distinctions for service providers and to a reduction in the level of protection for data
         subjects. Such a situation should be avoided. The need for consistency justifies the adoption of Directive 2006/24 under the
         EC Treaty.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point56">56</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be noted at the outset that the question of the areas of competence of the European Union presents itself differently
         depending on whether the competence in issue has already been accorded to the European Union in the broad sense or has not
         yet been accorded to it. In the first hypothesis, it is a question of ruling on the division of areas of competence within
         the Union and, more particularly, on whether it is appropriate to proceed by way of a directive based on the EC Treaty or
         by way of a framework decision based on the EU Treaty. By contrast, in the second hypothesis, it is a question of ruling on
         the division of areas of competence between the Union and the Member States and, more particularly, on whether the Union has
         encroached on the latters&#8217; areas of competence. The present case comes under the first of those two hypotheses.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point57">57</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be stated that the action brought by Ireland relates solely to the choice of legal basis and not to any possible

         2006/24.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point58">58</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland, supported by the Slovak Republic, contends that Directive 2006/24 cannot be based on Article 95 EC since its &#8216;centre

         on the functioning of the internal market (see, to that effect, Case C&#8209;380/03 <I>Germany</I> v <I>Parliament and Council</I> [2006] ECR I-11573, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point65">65</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to ascertain whether the situation which led to the adoption of Directive 2006/24 satisfies the conditions

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point66">66</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is apparent from recitals 5 and 6 in the preamble to that directive, the Community legislature started from the premiss
         that there were legislative and technical disparities between the national provisions governing the retention of data by service
         providers.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point67">67</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that connection, the evidence submitted to the Court confirms that, following the terrorist attacks mentioned in paragraph
         36 of this judgment, several Member States, realising that data relating to electronic communications constitute an effective
         means for the detection and prevention of crimes, including terrorism, adopted measures pursuant to Article 15(1) of Directive
         2002/58 with a view to imposing obligations on service providers concerning the retention of such data.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point68">68</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also clear from the file that the obligations relating to data retention have significant economic implications for

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point69">69</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence submitted to the Court shows, moreover, that the national measures adopted up to 2005 pursuant to Article 15(1)

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point70">70</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it was entirely foreseeable that the Member States which did not yet have rules on data retention would introduce

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point72">72</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a situation justified the Community legislature in pursuing the objective of safeguarding the proper functioning of the

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point73">73</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it must also be noted that, by laying down a harmonised level of retention of data relating to electronic communications,

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point79">79</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to determine whether the legislature has chosen a suitable legal basis for the adoption of Directive 2006/24, it
         is also appropriate, as follows from paragraph 60 of this judgment, to examine the substantive content of its provisions.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point80">80</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that connection, the provisions of Directive 2006/24 are essentially limited to the activities of service providers and

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point81">81</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, the provisions of Directive 2006/24 are designed to harmonise national laws on the obligation to retain

         and data security (Article 7) and the conditions for data storage (Article 8).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point82">82</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the measures provided for by Directive 2006/24 do not, in themselves, involve intervention by the police or law-enforcement
         authorities of the Member States. Thus, as is clear in particular from Article 3 of the directive, it is provided that service
         providers are to retain only data that are generated or processed in the course of the provision of the relevant communication
         services. Those data are solely those which are closely linked to the exercise of the commercial activity of the service providers.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point83">83</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directive 2006/24 thus regulates operations which are independent of the implementation of any police and judicial cooperation
         in criminal matters. It harmonises neither the issue of access to data by the competent national law-enforcement authorities
         nor that relating to the use and exchange of those data between those authorities. Those matters, which fall, in principle,
         within the area covered by Title VI of the EU Treaty, have been excluded from the provisions of that directive, as is stated,
         in particular, in recital 25 in the preamble to, and Article 4 of, Directive 2006/24.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point85">85</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of that substantive content, Directive 2006/24 relates predominantly to the functioning of the internal market.

         and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of PNR data by Air Carriers to the United States Department

         2004 on the adequate protection of personal data contained in the Passenger Name Record of air passengers transferred to the
         United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (OJ 2004 L 235, p.&nbsp;11).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point88">88</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter decision concerned the transfer of passenger data from the reservation systems of air carriers situated in the

         The Court held that that the subject-matter of that decision was data-processing which was not necessary for a supply of services
         by the air carriers, but which was regarded as necessary for safeguarding public security and for law-enforcement purposes.
         In paragraphs 57 to 59 of the judgment in <I>Parliament</I> v <I>Council and Commission</I>, the Court held that such data-processing was covered by Article 3(2) of Directive 95/46, according to which that directive
         does not apply, in particular, to the processing of personal data relating to public security and the activities of the State
         in areas of criminal law. The Court accordingly concluded that Decision 2004/535 did not fall within the scope of Directive
