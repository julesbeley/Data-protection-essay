      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">Directive 2000/31 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the internal
         market (Directive on electronic commerce), Directive 2001/29 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related
         rights in the information society, Directive 2004/48 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and Directive 2002/58
         concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive
         on privacy and electronic communications) do not require the Member States to lay down an obligation to communicate personal
         data in order to ensure effective protection of copyright in the context of civil proceedings, in a situation in which a non-profit-making
         organisation of producers and publishers of musical and audiovisual recordings has brought proceedings seeking an order that
         a provider of internet access services disclose to the organisation the identities and physical addresses of certain subscribers,
         so as to enable civil proceedings to be brought for infringement of copyright.
      </P>
      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">Similarly, as to Articles 41, 42 and 47 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement),
         in the light of which Community law must as far as possible be interpreted where it regulates a field to which that agreement
         applies, while they require the effective protection of intellectual property rights and the institution of judicial remedies
         for their enforcement, they do not contain provisions which require those directives to be interpreted as compelling the Member
         States to lay down an obligation to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings.
      </P>
      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">However, Community law requires that, when transposing those directives, the Member States take care to rely on an interpretation
         of them which allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order.
         Further, when implementing the measures transposing those directives, the authorities and courts of the Member States must
         not only interpret their national law in a manner consistent with those directives but also make sure that they do not rely
         on an interpretation of them which would be in conflict with those fundamental rights or with the other general principles
         of Community law, such as the principle of proportionality.

         those persons used the KaZaA file exchange program (peer-to-peer or P2P) and provided access in shared files of personal computers

         is authorised only in a criminal investigation or for the purpose of safeguarding public security and national defence, not
         in civil proceedings or as a preliminary measure relating to civil proceedings. Promusicae submitted for its part that Article

      <P class="C02AlineaAltA">&#8216;Does Community law, specifically Articles 15(2) and 18 of Directive [2000/31], Article 8(1) and (2) of Directive [2001/29],
         Article 8 of Directive [2004/48] and Articles 17(2) and 47 of the Charter &#8230; permit Member States to limit to the context of

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its written observations the Italian Government submits that the statements in point 11 of the order for reference indicate

         were interpreted as limiting the duty to disclose personal data to the field of criminal investigations or the protection
         of public safety and national defence. Since the national court does not exclude the possibility of that legislation being
         interpreted as not containing such a limitation, the question thus appears, according to the Italian Government, to be hypothetical,

         which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances
         of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions
         which it submits to the Court (Case C&#8209;217/05 <I>Confederaci&oacute;n Espa&ntilde;ola de Empresarios de Estaciones de Servicio</I> [2006] ECR I&#8209;11987, paragraph 16 and the case-law cited).

         or hypothetical questions, or that the interpretation of Community law requested bears no relation to the actual facts of
         the main action or its purpose, or that the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give
         a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see <I>Confederaci&oacute;n Espa&ntilde;ola de Empresarios de Estaciones de Servicio</I>, paragraph 17).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point38">38</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as regards the division of responsibilities under the cooperative arrangements established by Article 234 EC, the
         interpretation of provisions of national law is admittedly a matter for the national courts, not for the Court of Justice,
         and the Court has no jurisdiction, in proceedings brought on the basis of that article, to rule on the compatibility of national
         rules of law with Community law. On the other hand, the Court does have jurisdiction to provide the national court with all
         the guidance as to the interpretation of Community law necessary to enable that court to rule on the compatibility of national
         rules with Community law (see, to that effect, Case C&#8209;506/04 <I>Wilson</I> [2006] ECR I&#8209;8613, paragraphs 34 and 35, and Joined Cases C&#8209;338/04, C&#8209;359/04 and C&#8209;360/04 <I>Placanica and Others</I> [2007] ECR I&#8209;1891, paragraph 36).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point39">39</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of the present reference for a preliminary ruling, it is perfectly clear from the grounds of the order
         for reference as a whole that the national court considers that the interpretation of Article 12 of the LSSI depends on the
         compatibility of that provision with the relevant provisions of Community law, and hence on the interpretation of those provisions
         which it asks the Court to provide. Since the outcome of the main proceedings is thus linked to that interpretation, the question
         referred clearly does not appear hypothetical, so that the ground of inadmissibility put forward by the Italian Government
         cannot be accepted.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point41">41</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its question the national court asks essentially whether Community law, in particular Directives 2000/31, 2001/29 and 2004/48,
         read also in the light of Articles 17 and 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as requiring Member States to lay down, in
         order to ensure effective protection of copyright, an obligation to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if, formally, the national court has limited its question to the interpretation of Directives 2000/31, 2001/29 and 2004/48
         and the Charter, that circumstance does not prevent the Court from providing the national court with all the elements of interpretation
         of Community law which may be of use for deciding the case before it, whether or not that court has referred to them in the
         wording of its question (see Case C&#8209;392/05 <I>Alevizos</I> [2007] ECR I&#8209;3505, paragraph 64 and the case-law cited).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be observed to begin with that the intention of the provisions of Community law thus referred to in the question
         is that the Member States should ensure, especially in the information society, effective protection of industrial property,
         in particular copyright, which Promusicae claims in the main proceedings. The national court proceeds, however, from the premiss
         that the Community law obligations required by that protection may be blocked, in national law, by the provisions of Article
         12 of the LSSI.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point44">44</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While that law, in 2002, transposed the provisions of Directive 2000/31 into domestic law, it is common ground that Article
         12 of the law is intended to implement the rules for the protection of private life, which is also required by Community law
         under Directives 95/46 and 2002/58, the latter of which concerns the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy
         in the electronic communications sector, which is the sector at issue in the main proceedings.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not disputed that the communication sought by Promusicae of the names and addresses of certain users of KaZaA involves
         the making available of personal data, that is, information relating to identified or identifiable natural persons, in accordance
         with the definition in Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46 (see, to that effect, Case C&#8209;101/01 <I>Lindqvist</I> [2003] ECR I&#8209;12971, paragraph 24). That communication of information which, as Promusicae submits and Telef&oacute;nica does not
         contest, is stored by Telef&oacute;nica constitutes the processing of personal data within the meaning of the first paragraph of
         Article 2 of Directive 2002/58, read in conjunction with Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46. It must therefore be accepted that
         that communication falls within the scope of Directive 2002/58, although the compliance of the data storage itself with the
         requirements of that directive is not at issue in the main proceedings.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, it should first be ascertained whether Directive 2002/58 precludes the Member States from laying down,
         with a view to ensuring effective protection of copyright, an obligation to communicate personal data which will enable the
         copyright holder to bring civil proceedings based on the existence of that right. If that is not the case, it will then have
         to be ascertained whether it follows directly from the three directives expressly mentioned by the national court that the
         Member States are required to lay down such an obligation. Finally, if that is not the case either, in order to provide the
         national court with an answer of use to it, it will have to be examined, starting from the national court&#8217;s reference to the
         Charter, whether in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings other rules of Community law might require a
         different reading of those three directives.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 5(1) of Directive 2002/58 provides that Member States must ensure the confidentiality of communications by means of
         a public communications network and publicly available electronic communications services, and of the related traffic data,
         and must inter alia prohibit, in principle, the storage of that data by persons other than users, without the consent of the
         users concerned. The only exceptions relate to persons lawfully authorised in accordance with Article 15(1) of that directive
         and the technical storage necessary for conveyance of a communication. In addition, as regards traffic data, Article 6(1)
         of Directive 2002/58 provides that stored traffic data must be erased or made anonymous when it is no longer needed for the
         purpose of the transmission of a communication without prejudice to paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of that article and Article 15(1)
         of the directive.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, first, to paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of Article 6, which relate to the processing of traffic data in accordance with
         the requirements of billing and marketing services and the provision of value added services, those provisions do not concern
         the communication of that data to persons other than those acting under the authority of the providers of public communications
         networks and publicly available electronic communications services. As to the provisions of Article 6(6) of Directive 2002/58,
         they do not relate to disputes other than those between suppliers and users concerning the grounds for storing data in connection
         with the activities referred to in the other provisions of that article. Since Article 6(6) thus clearly does not concern
         a situation such as that of Promusicae in the main proceedings, it cannot be taken into account in assessing that situation.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect, second, to Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58, it should be recalled that under that provision the Member States
         may adopt legislative measures to restrict the scope inter alia of the obligation to ensure the confidentiality of traffic
         data, where such a restriction constitutes a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure within a democratic society
         to safeguard national security (i.e. State security), defence, public security, and the prevention, investigation, detection
         and prosecution of criminal offences or of unauthorised use of the electronic communications system, as referred to in Article
         13(1) of Directive 95/46.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58 thus gives Member States the possibility of providing for exceptions to the obligation

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, none of these exceptions appears to relate to situations that call for the bringing of civil proceedings. They concern,

         to the fields of activity of individuals (see, to that effect, <I>Lindqvist</I>, paragraph 43), and, second, the prosecution of criminal offences.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the exception relating to unauthorised use of the electronic communications system, this appears to concern use

         Directive 2002/58 of the interception or surveillance of communications without the consent of the users concerned. Such use,
         which, under that article, makes it necessary for the Member States to intervene, also does not relate to situations that
         may give rise to civil proceedings.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, however, that Article 15(1) of Directive 2002/58 ends the list of the above exceptions with an express reference
         to Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46. That provision also authorises the Member States to adopt legislative measures to restrict
         the obligation of confidentiality of personal data where that restriction is necessary inter alia for the protection of the
         rights and freedoms of others. As they do not specify the rights and freedoms concerned, those provisions of Article 15(1)
         of Directive 2002/58 must be interpreted as expressing the Community legislature&#8217;s intention not to exclude from their scope
         the protection of the right to property or situations in which authors seek to obtain that protection in civil proceedings.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion must therefore be that Directive 2002/58 does not preclude the possibility for the Member States of laying

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point56">56</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must therefore be ascertained whether the three directives mentioned by the national court require those States to lay

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point57">57</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should first be noted that, as pointed out in paragraph 43 above, the purpose of the directives mentioned by the national
         court is that the Member States should ensure, especially in the information society, effective protection of industrial property,
         in particular copyright. However, it follows from Article 1(5)(b) of Directive 2000/31, Article 9 of Directive 2001/29 and
         Article 8(3)(e) of Directive 2004/48 that such protection cannot affect the requirements of the protection of personal data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point58">58</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 8(1) of Directive 2004/48 admittedly requires Member States to ensure that, in the context of proceedings concerning

         the competent judicial authorities may order that information on the origin and distribution networks of the goods or services
         which infringe an intellectual property right be provided. However, it does not follow from those provisions, which must be
         read in conjunction with those of paragraph 3(e) of that article, that they require the Member States to lay down, in order

         to communicate personal data in the context of civil proceedings leads to an infringement of the fundamental right to property

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point63">63</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation in respect of which the national court puts that question involves, in addition to those two rights,

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point64">64</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to recital 2 in the preamble to Directive 2002/58, the directive seeks to respect the fundamental rights and observes
         the principles recognised in particular by the Charter. In particular, the directive seeks to ensure full respect for the
         rights set out in Articles 7 and 8 of that Charter. Article 7 substantially reproduces Article 8 of the European Convention
         for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms signed at Rome on 4 November 1950, which guarantees the right
         to respect for private life, and Article 8 of the Charter expressly proclaims the right to protection of personal data.

         lawful and what safeguards must be provided for, and in the three directives mentioned by the national court, which reserve
         the cases in which the measures adopted to protect the rights they regulate affect the protection of personal data. Second,
         they result from the adoption by the Member States of national provisions transposing those directives and their application
         by the national authorities (see, to that effect, with reference to Directive 95/46, <I>Lindqvist</I>, paragraph 82).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point67">67</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to those directives, their provisions are relatively general, since they have to be applied to a large number of different
