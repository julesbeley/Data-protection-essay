      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point1">1.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guarantee of the independence of national supervisory authorities, provided for by the second subparagraph of Article
         28(1) of Directive 95/46 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement
         of such data, is intended to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the supervision of compliance with the provisions
         on protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and must be interpreted in the light of that aim.
         It was established, not to grant a special status to those authorities themselves and their agents, but in order to strengthen
         the protection of individuals and bodies affected by their decisions. It follows that, when carrying out their duties, the
         supervisory authorities must act objectively and impartially. For that purpose, they must remain free from any external influence,
         including the direct or indirect influence of the State or the L&auml;nder, and not of the influence only of the supervised bodies.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Consequently, the supervisory authorities responsible for supervising the processing of personal data outside the public sector
         must enjoy an independence allowing them to perform their duties free from external influence. That independence precludes
         not only any influence exercised by the supervised bodies, but also any directions or any other external influence, whether
         direct or indirect, which could call into question the performance by those authorities of their task consisting of establishing
         a fair balance between the protection of the right to private life and the free movement of personal data.

      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point2">2.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mere risk that the scrutinising authorities could exercise a political influence over the decisions of the supervisory
         authorities responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data, provided for by the second subparagraph of Article
         28(1) of Directive 95/46 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement
         of such data, is enough to hinder the latter authorities&#8217; independent performance of their tasks. First, there could be &#8216;prior
         compliance&#8217; on the part of those authorities in the light of the scrutinising authority&#8217;s decision-making practice. Secondly,
         for the purposes of the role adopted by those supervisory authorities as guardians of the right to private life, it is necessary
         that their decisions, and therefore the authorities themselves, remain above any suspicion of partiality. The State scrutiny
         exercised over the national supervisory authorities responsible for supervising the processing of personal data outside the
         public sector is therefore not consistent with the requirement of independence.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Consequently, by making the authorities responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data by non-public bodies and
         undertakings governed by public law which compete on the market in the different L&auml;nder subject to State scrutiny, and by

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point15">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the view of the Commission and the EDPS, which rely on a broad interpretation of the words &#8216;with complete independence&#8217;,
         the requirement that the supervisory authorities exercise their functions &#8216;with complete independence&#8217; must be interpreted
         as meaning that a supervising authority must be free from any influence, whether that influence is exercised by other authorities
         or outside the administration. The fact that the authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions on the
         protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data outside the public sector are subject to State scrutiny
         in Germany constitutes an infringement of that requirement.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point16">16</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Republic of Germany proposes, on the contrary, a narrower interpretation of the words &#8216;with complete independence&#8217;
         and maintains that the second subparagraph of Article 28(1) of Directive 95/46 requires the supervisory authorities to have
         functional independence in the sense that those authorities must be independent of bodies outside the public sector which
         are under their supervision and that they must not be exposed to external influences. However, in the view of the Federal
         Republic of Germany, the State scrutiny exercised in the German <I>L&auml;nder</I> does not constitute such an external influence, but rather the administration&#8217;s internal monitoring mechanism, implemented
         by the authorities attached to the same administrative machinery as the supervisory authorities and required, like the latter,
         to fulfil the aims of Directive 95/46.

      <P class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<I>Findings of the Court</I></P>
      <P class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;The scope of the requirement of independence of the supervisory authorities</P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point17">17</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment of the substance of the present action depends on the scope of the requirement of independence contained in
         the second subparagraph of Article 28(1) of Directive 95/46 and, therefore, on the interpretation of that provision. In that
         context, the wording itself of that provision and the aims and scheme of Directive 95/46 should be taken into account.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point18">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard, in the first place, to the wording of the second subparagraph of Article 28(1) of Directive 95/46, because the
         words &#8216;with complete independence&#8217; are not defined by that directive, it is necessary to take their usual meaning into account.
         In relation to a public body, the term &#8216;independence&#8217; normally means a status which ensures that the body concerned can act
         completely freely, without taking any instructions or being put under any pressure.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point19">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the position taken by the Federal Republic of Germany, there is nothing to indicate that the requirement of independence
         concerns exclusively the relationship between the supervisory authorities and the bodies subject to that supervision. On the
         contrary, the concept of &#8216;independence&#8217; is complemented by the adjective &#8216;complete&#8217;, which implies a decision-making power
         independent of any direct or indirect external influence on the supervisory authority.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point20">20</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second place, concerning the objectives of Directive 95/46, it is apparent from the third, seventh and eighth recitals
         in the preamble thereto that, through the harmonisation of national provisions on the protection of individuals with regard
         to the processing of personal data, that directive seeks principally to ensure the free movement of such data between the
         Member States, which is necessary for the establishment of and the functioning of the internal market, within the meaning
         of Article 14(2) EC (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C&#8209;465/00, C&#8209;138/01 and C&#8209;139/01 <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others</I> [2003] ECR I&#8209;4989, paragraphs 39 and 70).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point21">21</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the free movement of personal data is liable to interfere with the right to private life as recognised, inter alia,
         in Article 8 of the ECHR (see, to that effect, the following judgments of the European Court of Human Rights: <I>Amann</I> v <I>Switzerland</I>, 16 February 2000, ECHR 2000-II, &sect;&sect; 69 and 80, and <I>Rotaru</I> v <I>Romania</I>, 4 May 2000, ECHR 2000-V, &sect;&sect; 43 and 46) and the general principles of European Community law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point22">22</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, and as is apparent in particular from the 10th recital in the preamble to, and from Article 1 of, Directive
         95/46, the latter seeks also not to weaken the protection guaranteed by the existing national rules, but on the contrary to
         ensure, in the European Community, a high level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms with respect to the processing
         of personal data (see, to that effect, <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others</I>, paragraph 70, and Case C&#8209;73/07 <I>Satakunnan Markkinap&ouml;rssi and Satamedia</I> [2008] ECR I&#8209;0000, paragraph 52).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point23">23</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisory authorities provided for in Article 28 of Directive 95/46 are therefore the guardians of those fundamental
         rights and freedoms, and their existence in the Member States is considered, as is stated in the 62nd recital in the preamble
         to Directive 95/46, as an essential component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point24">24</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to guarantee that protection, the supervisory authorities must ensure a fair balance between, on the one hand, observance
         of the fundamental right to private life and, on the other hand, the interests requiring free movement of personal data. Furthermore,
         under Article 28(6) of Directive 95/46, the different national authorities are called upon to cooperate with one another and
         even, if necessary, to exercise their powers at the request of an authority of another Member State.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point25">25</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guarantee of the independence of national supervisory authorities is intended to ensure the effectiveness and reliability
         of the supervision of compliance with the provisions on protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal
         data and must be interpreted in the light of that aim. It was established not to grant a special status to those authorities
         themselves as well as their agents, but in order to strengthen the protection of individuals and bodies affected by their
         decisions. It follows that, when carrying out their duties, the supervisory authorities must act objectively and impartially.
         For that purpose, they must remain free from any external influence, including the direct or indirect influence of the State
         or the <I>L&auml;nder</I>, and not of the influence only of the supervised bodies.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point26">26</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning, in the third place, the scheme of Directive 95/46, the latter must be understood as the equivalent of Article
         286 EC and Regulation No 45/2001. The latter concern the processing of personal data by European Community institutions and
         organs and the free movement of that data. Directive 95/46 also seeks to achieve those aims, but with regard to the processing
         of such data within the Member States.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point27">27</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way as supervisory bodies exist at national level, a supervisory body responsible for ensuring the application
         of the rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is also provided for at European
         Community level, namely, the EDPS. In accordance with Article 44(1) of Regulation No 45/2001, that body is to perform its
         duties in complete independence. Article 44(2) thereof clarifies that concept of independence by adding that, in the performance
         of its duties, the EDPS may neither seek nor take instructions from anybody.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point28">28</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the fact that Article 44 of Regulation No 45/2001 and Article 28 of Directive 95/46 are based on the same general
         concept, those two provisions should be interpreted homogeneously, so that not only the independence of the EDPS, but also
         that of the national authorities, involve the lack of any instructions relating to the performance of their duties.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point29">29</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By relying on the wording itself of the second subparagraph of Article 28(1) of Directive 95/46 and on the aims and scheme
         of that directive, it is possible to reach a clear interpretation of the second subparagraph of Article 28(1) thereof. It
         is therefore not necessary to take into account the origins of that directive, or to rule on the arguments presented by the
         Commission and the Federal Republic of Germany, which are contradictory on that point.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point30">30</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the foregoing, the second subparagraph of Article 28(1) of Directive 95/46 is to be interpreted as meaning
         that the supervisory authorities responsible for supervising the processing of personal data outside the public sector must
         enjoy an independence allowing them to perform their duties free from external influence. That independence precludes not
         only any influence exercised by the supervised bodies, but also any directions or any other external influence, whether direct
         or indirect, which could call into question the performance by those authorities of their task consisting of establishing
         a fair balance between the protection of the right to private life and the free movement of personal data.
      </P>
      <P class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;State Scrutiny</P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point31">31</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is next necessary to assess whether the State scrutiny to which the supervisory authorities are subject in Germany is consistent
         with the requirement of independence as defined above.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point32">32</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the State scrutiny, whatever form it takes, in principle allows the government of the respective <I>Land</I> or an administrative body subject to that government to influence, directly or indirectly, the decisions of the supervisory
         authorities or, as the case may be, to cancel and replace those decisions.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point33">33</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, it should be acknowledged <I>a priori</I>, as is claimed by the Federal Republic of Germany, that the State seeks only to guarantee that acts of the supervisory authorities
         comply with the applicable national and European Community provisions, and that it therefore does not aim to oblige those
         authorities potentially to pursue political objectives inconsistent with the protection of individuals with regard to the
         processing of personal data and with fundamental rights.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point34">34</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the possibility remains that the scrutinising authorities, which are part of the general administration and therefore
         under the control of the government of their respective <I>Land</I>, are not able to act objectively when they interpret and apply the provisions relating to the processing of personal data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by the EDPS in its observations, the government of the <I>Land</I> concerned may have an interest in not complying with the provisions with regard to the protection of personal data where
         the processing of such data by a non-public body is at issue. That government may itself be an interested party in that processing
         if it actually or potentially participates therein, for example, in the case of a public-private partnership or in the case
         of public contracts with the private sector. That government may also have a specific interest if it is necessary or even
         merely useful for it to have access to databases in order to fulfil certain of its functions, in particular for taxation or
         law enforcement purposes. Furthermore, that government may also tend to favour economic interests in the application of the
         provisions on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by certain companies which are
         economically important for the <I>Land</I> or region.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point36">36</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the mere risk that the scrutinising authorities could exercise a political influence
         over the decisions of the supervisory authorities is enough to hinder the latter authorities&#8217; independent performance of their
         tasks. First, as was stated by the Commission, there could be &#8216;prior compliance&#8217; on the part of those authorities in the light
         of the scrutinising authority&#8217;s decision-making practice. Secondly, for the purposes of the role adopted by those authorities
         as guardians of the right to private life, it is necessary that their decisions, and therefore the authorities themselves,
         remain above any suspicion of partiality.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point37">37</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the foregoing considerations, it must be held that the State scrutiny exercised over the German supervisory authorities
         responsible for supervising the processing of personal data outside the public sector is not consistent with the requirement
         of independence as defined in paragraph 30 of the present judgment.
      </P>
      <P class="C06Titre3">&nbsp;The principles of Community law pleaded by the Federal Republic of Germany</P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point38">38</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Republic of Germany contends that it would be contrary to various principles of European Community law to interpret
         the requirement of independence in the second subparagraph of Article 28(1) of Directive 95/46 in a way which would oblige
         that Member State to renounce its tried and tested system of scrutiny of the supervisory authorities with regard to the processing
         of personal data outside the public sector.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point39">39</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the opinion of that Member State, the principle of democracy, in particular, precludes a broad interpretation of
         that requirement of independence.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point40">40</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That principle, which is enshrined not only in the German constitution, but also in Article 6(1) EU, requires that the administration
         be subject to the instructions of the government which is accountable to its parliament. Thus, the legality of interventions
         concerning the rights of citizens and undertakings should be subject to the scrutiny of the competent minister. Since the
         supervisory authorities responsible for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data have
         certain powers of intervention with regard to citizens and entities outside the public sector under Article 28(3) of Directive
         95/46, a heightened scrutiny of the legality of their activities by means of instruments for monitoring legality or substance
         is absolutely necessary.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point41">41</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the principle of democracy forms part of European Community law and was expressly enshrined in Article
         6(1) EU as one of the foundations of the European Union. As one of the principles common to the Member States, it must be
         taken into consideration when interpreting acts of secondary law such as Article 28 of Directive 95/46.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That principle does not preclude the existence of public authorities outside the classic hierarchical administration and more
         or less independent of the government. The existence and conditions of operation of such authorities are, in the Member States,
         regulated by the law or even, in certain States, by the Constitution and those authorities are required to comply with the
         law subject to the review of the competent courts. Such independent administrative authorities, as exist moreover in the German
         judicial system, often have regulatory functions or carry out tasks which must be free from political influence, whilst still
         being required to comply with the law subject to the review of the competent courts. That is precisely the case with regard
         to the tasks of the supervisory authorities relating to the protection of data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, the absence of any parliamentary influence over those authorities is inconceivable. However, it should be pointed
         out that Directive 95/46 in no way makes such an absence of any parliamentary influence obligatory for the Member States.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point44">44</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, first, the management of the supervisory authorities may be appointed by the parliament or the government. Secondly,
         the legislator may define the powers of those authorities.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the legislator may impose an obligation on the supervisory authorities to report their activities to the parliament.
         In that regard, a comparison may be made with Article 28(5) of Directive 95/46 which provides that each supervisory authority
         is to draw up a report on its activities at regular intervals which will then be made public.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the foregoing, conferring a status independent of the general administration on the supervisory authorities responsible
         for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data outside the public sector does not in itself
         deprive those authorities of their democratic legitimacy.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the principle of conferred powers enshrined in the first paragraph of Article 5&nbsp;EC, also pleaded by the Federal
         Republic of Germany, obliges the Community to act within the limits of the powers conferred on it and of the objectives assigned
         to it by the EC Treaty.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Republic of Germany contends in that regard that the independence of the supervisory authorities in relation to
         the higher administrative authorities could not be required on the basis of Article 100A of the EC Treaty, which serves as
         the basis of Directive 95/46.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That provision empowers the Community legislature to adopt measures to improve the conditions for the establishment and functioning

         freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaty (see, in particular, Case C&#8209;376/98 <I>Germany</I> v <I>Parliament and Council </I>[2000] ECR I&#8209;8419, paragraphs 83, 84 and 95; Case C&#8209;491/01 <I>British American Tobacco (Investments) and Imperial Tobacco</I> [2002] ECR I&#8209;11453, paragraph 60; and Case C&#8209;436/03 <I>Parliament</I> v <I>Council</I> [2006] ECR I&#8209;3733, paragraph 38).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been stated, the independence of the supervisory authorities, in so far as they must be free from any external
         influence liable to have an effect on their decisions, is an essential element in light of the objectives of Directive 95/46.
         That independence is necessary in all the Member States in order to create an equal level of protection of personal data and
         thereby to contribute to the free movement of data, which is necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal
         market.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the foregoing, a broad interpretation of the requirement of independence of the supervisory authorities does not

         basis of Directive 95/46.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third place, the Federal Republic of Germany pleads the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, in the second
         and third paragraphs of Article 5 EC, and the principle of cooperation in good faith between the Member States and the Community
         institutions enshrined in Article 10 EC.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It notes in particular Paragraph 7 of the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality,

         law, care should be taken to respect well established national arrangements and the organisation and working of Member States&#8217;

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be inconsistent with that requirement to oblige the Federal Republic of Germany to adopt a system which is foreign

         as a model for legislation on the protection of data, well beyond the national level.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those arguments cannot be accepted. As was stated in paragraphs 21 to 25 and 50 of the present judgment, the interpretation
