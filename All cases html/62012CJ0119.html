It states, first, that ‘billing’, which is one of the objectives in respect of which Article 6(2) and (5) of that directive authorises the processing of traffic data, does not necessarily include the collection of the amount invoiced. However, it takes the view there is no objective reason for treating billing and debt collection differently with respect to data protection. Second, Article 6(5) of that directive restricts the processing of traffic data to persons acting under the authority of providers of the public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services (‘service provider’). According to the referring court, it is unclear from that definition whether the service provider must actually be able to determine the use of the data, including on a case-by-case basis, throughout the duration of the data processing or whether it is sufficient that general rules relating to respect for the privacy of telecommunications and data protection are laid down, such as those agreed in the present case in the contractual provisions, and that it is possible for the data to be erased or returned on request.</p>

In particular, the contract concluded between the service provider which assigns its claims for payment and the party to which those claims are assigned must contain provisions of such a kind as to ensure the lawful processing of traffic data by the latter and must allow the service provider to ensure at all times that those provisions are being complied with by the assignee.</p>

The fact that a factoring contract has the characteristics described in the question referred suggests that that contract satisfies those conditions. Such a contract allows the processing of traffic data by the assignee of claims for payment only in so far as such processing is necessary for the collection of those debts and imposes on that assignee the obligation immediately and irreversibly to erase or return those data as soon as knowledge thereof is no longer necessary for the recovery of the claims concerned. Furthermore, it allows the service provider to check whether there is compliance with the rules on security and data protection on the part of the assignee, which may, on simple request, be obliged to erase or to return the traffic data.</p>
