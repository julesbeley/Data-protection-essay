         Legal persons can thus claim the protection of Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter only in so far as the official title of the

         natural persons who are its partners.

      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point2">2.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 52(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union accepts that limitations may be imposed on the exercise
         of rights such as those set forth in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, as long as the limitations are provided for by law,
         respect the essence of those rights and freedoms, and, subject to the principle of proportionality, are necessary and genuinely
         meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.
         The limitations which may lawfully be imposed on the right to the protection of personal data correspond to those tolerated
         in relation to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
      </P>
      <P class="S36Renvoi">(see paras 52, 65)</P>
      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point3">3.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy, as amended by Regulation
         No 1437/2007, and Regulation No 259/2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation No 1290/2005 as regards
         the publication of information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF)
         and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) are invalid in so far as, with regard to natural persons
         who are beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid, those provisions impose an obligation to publish personal data relating to each
         beneficiary without drawing a distinction based on relevant criteria such as the periods during which those persons have received
         such aid, the frequency of such aid or the nature and amount thereof.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">The amounts which the beneficiaries receive from the EAGF and the EAFRD represent part of their income, often a considerable
         part, and because the information becomes available to third parties, publication on a website of data naming those beneficiaries
         and indicating the precise amounts received by them constitutes an interference with their private life within the meaning
         of Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is of no relevance in this respect that the data
         published concerns activities of a professional nature. Moreover, the publication required by Article 44a of Regulation No
         1290/2005 and Regulation No 259/2008 constitutes the processing of personal data falling under Article 8(2) of the Charter.
         Furthermore, the fact that the beneficiaries have been informed of the mandatory publication of the data relating to them
         does not call in question the very existence of an interference with their private life, since Article 42(8b) of Regulation
         No 1290/2005 and Article 4(1) of Regulation No 259/2008, which merely provide that beneficiaries of aid are to be informed
         in advance that the data concerning them will be published, do not seek to base the personal data processing for which they
         provide on the consent of the beneficiaries concerned.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Such an interference is not justified having regard to Article 52(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
         Union. While it is true that in a democratic society taxpayers have a right to be kept informed of the use of public funds,
         the fact remains that striking a proper balance between the various interests involved made it necessary for the institutions
         concerned, before adopting the provisions in question, to ascertain whether publication via a single freely consultable website
         in each Member State of data by name relating to all the beneficiaries concerned and the precise amounts received by each
         of them from the EAGF and the EAFRD &#8211; with no distinction being drawn according to the duration, frequency or nature and amount
         of the aid received &#8211; did not go beyond what was necessary for achieving the legitimate aims pursued, having regard in particular
         to the interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter resulting from such publication. In this
         respect, no automatic priority can be conferred on the objective of transparency over the right to protection of personal
         data, even if important economic interests are at stake. Since it does not appear that the institutions properly balanced,
         on the one hand, the objectives of Article 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 and of Regulation No 259/2008 against, on the other,
         the rights which natural persons are recognised as having under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, having regard to the fact
         that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary
         and that it is possible to envisage measures which affect less adversely that fundamental right of natural persons and which
         still contribute effectively to the objectives of the European Union rules in question, the Council and Commission, by requiring
         the publication of the names of all natural persons who were beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid and of the exact amounts
         received by those persons, exceeded the limits which compliance with the principle of proportionality imposes.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">By contrast, with regard to the legal persons which received EAGF and EAFRD aid, and in so far as they may invoke the rights
         conferred by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter, the view must be taken that the obligation to publish which follows from Articles
         42(8b) and 44a of Regulation No 1290/2005 and Regulation No 259/2008 does not go beyond the limits imposed by compliance with
         the principle of proportionality. The seriousness of the breach of the right to protection of personal data manifests itself
         in different ways for legal persons and natural persons. Legal persons are already subject to a more onerous obligation in
         respect of the publication of data relating to them. Furthermore, the obligation on the competent national authorities to
         examine, before the data in question are published and for each legal person which is a beneficiary of EAGF or EAFRD aid,
         whether the name of that person identifies natural persons would impose on those authorities an unreasonable administrative
         burden.

         the aim of increasing the transparency of the use of European funds, does not improve the prevention of irregularities, since
         extensive control mechanisms exist at present for that purpose. On the basis of the judgment in Joined Cases C&#8209;465/00, C&#8209;138/01
         and C&#8209;139/01 <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others</I> [2003] ECR I&#8209;4989, it takes the view that, in any event, that obligation to publish is not proportionate to the aim pursued.
         Moreover, in its view, Article 42(8b) of Regulation No&nbsp;1290/2005 gives the Commission too broad a discretion with respect
         to determining both the data to be published and the means of publication and is therefore incompatible with the third indent

         be published exclusively on the internet, breaches the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. It points out
         that the latter regulation does not limit access to the internet site concerned to &#8216;internet protocol&#8217; (IP) addresses situated

         period laid down in Article 3(3) of Regulation No&nbsp;259/2008. It its view, publication of the data exclusively on the internet
         also has a deterrent effect. First, citizens wishing to obtain information must have access to the internet. Second, those
         citizens run the risk of having their data stored under Directive 2006/24. It is paradoxical to strengthen the supervision
         of telecommunications on the one hand and to provide on the other hand that information which is intended to enable citizens
         to participate in public affairs is available only electronically.

         court further seeks an interpretation of a number of provisions of Directive 95/46. It considers that the publication of personal
         data may take place only if the measures provided for in the second indent of Article 18(2) of that directive have been taken.
         According to the information provided by the referring court, the German legislature, in particular that of the <I>Land</I> of Hesse, has made use of the possibility under that provision. However, according to that court, the notification by the
         Ministry of the Environment, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection of the <I>Land</I> of Hesse to the personal data protection official was incomplete. Some information was not communicated to that official,
         such as the fact that the data are processed by the Bundesanstalt on behalf of the <I>Land</I>, in some cases with the assistance of a private third party, specific details of the deletion period and the access provider,
         and information on the registration of IP addresses.

         check was carried out, not by a central supervisory authority, but by the data protection official of the undertaking or office

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point68">68</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of transparency is stated in Articles 1&nbsp;TEU and 10&nbsp;TEU and in Article 15&nbsp;TFEU. It enables citizens to participate

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point77">77</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus necessary to determine whether the Council of the European Union and the Commission balanced the European Union&#8217;s

         the right of the beneficiaries concerned to respect for their private life in general and to the protection of their personal
         data in particular. The Court has held in this respect that derogations and limitations in relation to the protection of personal

         by measures which interfere less with the right of the beneficiaries concerned to respect for their private life in general
         and the protection of their personal data in particular. Information limited to those of the beneficiaries concerned who receive
         aid exceeding a certain threshold would, it is submitted, not give taxpayers an accurate image of the CAP. Taxpayers would
         have the impression that there were only &#8216;big&#8217; beneficiaries of aid from the agricultural Funds, whereas there are numerous
         &#8216;little&#8217; ones. Limiting publication to legal persons only would not be satisfactory either. The Commission submits in this

         for the institutions, before adopting the provisions whose validity is contested, to ascertain whether publication via a single

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point81">81</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to show that, when adopting Article 44a of Regulation No&nbsp;1290/2005 and Regulation No 259/2008, the Council

         consistent with the objective of such publication while at the same time causing less interference with those beneficiaries&#8217;

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point83">83</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The institutions ought thus to have examined, in the course of striking a proper balance between the various interests involved,
         whether publication by name limited in the manner indicated in paragraph 81 above would have been sufficient to achieve the
         objectives of the European Union legislation at issue in the main proceedings. In particular, it does not appear that such
         a limitation, which would protect some of the beneficiaries concerned from interference with their private lives, would not
         provide citizens with a sufficiently accurate image of the aid granted by the EAGF and the EAFRD to achieve the objectives
         of that legislation.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point84">84</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member States which submitted written observations to the Court and the Council and the Commission refer also to the significant

         No&nbsp;1290/2005 and by Regulation No&nbsp;259/2008.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point85">85</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That argument must be rejected. It is necessary to bear in mind that the institutions are obliged to balance, before disclosing
         information relating to a natural person, the European Union&#8217;s interest in guaranteeing the transparency of its actions and
         the infringement of the rights recognised by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. No automatic priority can be conferred on the
         objective of transparency over the right to protection of personal data (see, to that effect, <I>Commission </I>v <I>Bavarian Lager</I>, paragraphs 75 to 79), even if important economic interests are at stake.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point86">86</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the foregoing that it does not appear that the institutions properly balanced, on the one hand, the objectives
         of Article 44a of Regulation No&nbsp;1290/2005 and of Regulation No&nbsp;259/2008 against, on the other, the rights which natural persons
         are recognised as having under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter. Regard being had to the fact that derogations and limitations
         in relation to the protection of personal data must apply only in so far as is strictly necessary (<I>Satakunnan Markkinap&ouml;rssi and Satamedia</I>, paragraph 56) and that it is possible to envisage measures which affect less adversely that fundamental right of natural
         persons and which still contribute effectively to the objectives of the European Union rules in question, it must be held
         that, by requiring the publication of the names of all natural persons who were beneficiaries of EAGF and EAFRD aid and of
         the exact amounts received by those persons, the Council and the Commission exceeded the limits which compliance with the

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point87">87</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with regard to the legal persons which received EAGF and EAFRD aid, and in so far as they may invoke the rights conferred
         by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (see paragraph 53 of the present judgment), the view must be taken that the obligation
         to publish which follows from the provisions of the European Union rules the validity of which has here been brought into
         question does not go beyond the limits imposed by compliance with the principle of proportionality. The seriousness of the
         breach of the right to protection of personal data manifests itself in different ways for, on the one hand, legal persons
         and, on the other, natural persons. It is necessary to point out in this regard that legal persons are already subject to
         a more onerous obligation in respect of the publication of data relating to them. Furthermore, the obligation on the competent
         national authorities to examine, before the data in question are published and for each legal person which is a beneficiary
         of EAGF or EAFRD aid, whether the name of that person identifies natural persons would impose on those authorities an unreasonable
         administrative burden (see, to that effect, judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, <I>K.U. v.</I><I>Finland</I>, 2&nbsp;March 2009, application no 2872/02, &sect;&nbsp;48, not yet published).

         44a of Regulation No&nbsp;1290/2005 and from Regulation No&nbsp;259/2008 may be effected only if the personal data protection official

         authority must be notified before any wholly or partly automatic operation for the processing of personal data, or any set
         of such operations intended to serve a single purpose or several related purposes, is carried out. As recital 48 in the preamble
         to Directive 95/46 explains, &#8216;the procedures for notifying the supervisory authority are designed to ensure disclosure of

         to present such risks. In view of the parallel relationship between the provisions of Directive 95/46 and those of Regulation
         No&nbsp;45/2001 which relate to prior checks, the listing in Article 27(2) of Regulation No&nbsp;45/2001 of the processing operations
         which are likely to present specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects must be considered relevant for the
         purpose of interpreting Article 20 of Directive 95/46.

         and by Regulation No&nbsp;259/2008 comes within any of the categories of processing operations covered by Article 27(2) of Regulation

         of Regulation No&nbsp;1290/2005 and from Regulation No&nbsp;259/2008 subject to the prior checks for which that Article 20 provides.

      <P class="C41DispositifIntroduction">On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:</P>
      <P class="C08Dispositif">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Articles 42(8b) and 44a of Council Regulation (EC) No&nbsp;1290/2005 of 21&nbsp;June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural
            policy, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No&nbsp;1437/2007 of 26&nbsp;November 2007, and Commission Regulation (EC) No 259/2008
            of 18&nbsp;March 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation No&nbsp;1290/2005 as regards the publication of information
            on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural
            Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) are invalid in so far as, with regard to natural persons who are beneficiaries of EAGF
            and EAFRD aid, those provisions impose an obligation to publish personal data relating to each beneficiary without drawing
            a distinction based on relevant criteria such as the periods during which those persons have received such aid, the frequency
            of such aid or the nature and amount thereof.</B></P>
      <P class="C08Dispositif">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The invalidity of the provisions of European Union law mentioned in paragraph 1 of this operative part does not allow any

            out by the national authorities on the basis of those provisions during the period prior to the date on which the present

            be interpreted as not placing the personal data protection official under an obligation to keep the register provided for
            by that provision before an operation for the processing of personal data, such as that resulting from Articles 42(8b) and
            44a of Regulation No&nbsp;1290/2005, as amended by Regulation No&nbsp;1437/2007, and from Regulation No&nbsp;259/2008, is carried out.</B></P>
