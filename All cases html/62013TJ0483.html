               <p class="normal">It is apparent from the initial audit report that there were anomalies in respect of personnel costs. Zenon had applied to the Commission for funding, in a significant amount, of expenses which had in reality been invoiced to it by the Cypriot company Comeng Computerised Engineering (‘Comeng’). Those costs were wrongly claimed under the category of direct personnel costs as costs for ‘in-house consultants’, whereas they should have been claimed as subcontracting costs. That practice had been systematic. The Commission concluded from this that those costs could not be considered admissible either as personnel costs or as subcontracting costs.</p>

In the event that criminal proceedings are not brought or are brought to a close by an acquittal, the bringing of an action for damages, before the EU judicature, is sufficient to ensure the protection of the interests of the person concerned by allowing that person to obtain compensation for any loss flowing from OLAF’s unlawful conduct (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 May 2010 in Commission v Violetti and Others, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AT%3A2010%3A215&locale=en"

The audit report also mentions the applicant’s name in the context of financial transactions conducted in the same period in favour of other companies owned or controlled by him and states that he did not demonstrate that those transactions occurred in the context of the performance, by Zenon, of contracts concluded for the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme. Such information also proved necessary in order to provide proof of the lack of a connection between those transactions and the performance of the FP6 contracts by Zenon. Furthermore, it is apparent from the audit report that it was the applicant who decided to resort to Comeng in order to deliver the invoices to Zenon and to conduct the banking transactions between the latter and Comeng. It must be stated that that information may be deduced from the email of 29 September 2010, sent by the applicant himself to the new director of Zenon and to the Commission by the new shareholders of that company. The applicant indicated therein that resort had been had to Comeng in order to inflate profits by 10% without the company suffering any losses. That data thus enabled the Commission to confirm that the resort to Comeng in the context of the performance of the contracts concluded for the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme was not an ‘error’, but was instead quite deliberate, to reject the argument that a mere miscalculation had been made, consequently to set aside Zenon’s proposal in its email of 18 October 2010 for a mere adjustment to the calculation of the personnel costs and, therefore, to justify the scope of the financial adjustment made in respect of Zenon. It is therefore not apparent that the transmission to Zenon of that information via the audit report was not consistent with Article 5 of Regulation No 45/2001.</p>

In so doing, the applicant admitted that he had deliberately resorted to a subcontracting arrangement and that the situation was not therefore the result of a miscalculation.

In response to that finding, Zenon observed that the contract required a high level of scientific knowledge and that it had thus had to resort to Comeng’s consultants, since they had specialised knowledge and skills in that regard. In those circumstances, and as noted by the Commission, the auditors required access to all data in order to be able to assess the individual costs of the people working on the project in order to determine whether the personnel costs differed significantly from the actual costs. It follows that the processing of certain personal data was necessary in the present case and that anonymous data would not have permitted the auditors to perform their task efficiently.</p>

It must therefore be held that the Commission infringed a rule of law whose purpose is to confer rights on the persons concerned by the personal data held by the institutions and bodies of the European Union (see the case-law cited in paragraph 51 above). However, the question arises whether that infringement may be regarded as sufficiently serious within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraph 42 above. In that regard, first, it is important to note that, under Regulation No 45/2001, the data protection officer’s role is to ensure that the processing of personal data does not affect the rights and freedoms of the relevant data subjects. In that context, his role is, inter alia, to warn the EDPS against any processing of data which could constitute a risk within the meaning of Article 27 of Regulation No 45/2001. It follows that, if the data protection officer is not informed of that data processing, he will himself not be in a position to notify the EDPS and therefore cannot effectively fulfil the essential task of supervision assigned to him by the European legislature.</p>

It is also apparent from that information that the practice of viewing Comeng’s personnel costs as in-house consultant costs was potentially systematic. The report further highlights the fact that the links between those two companies were not known and that it was the audit that made it possible to confirm the existence of an agreement signed on 1 April 2005 between Comeng and Zenon.</p>

               <p class="normal">The Court of Justice has also held that, by adopting Regulation No 2988/95 and, in particular, the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) thereof, the EU legislature intended to establish a general limitation rule applicable to that area, by which it intended, first, to define a minimum period applied in all the Member States and, secondly, to waive the possibility of recovering sums wrongly received from the EU budget after the expiry of a four-year period following the occurrence of the irregularity affecting the payments at issue. It follows that, as from the date on which Regulation No 2988/95 entered into force, any advantage wrongly received from the EU budget can, as a rule and apart from in the sectors for which the EU legislature has prescribed a shorter period, be recovered by the competent authorities of the Member States within a period of four years (judgment of 29 January 2009 in Josef Vosding Schlacht-, Kühl- und Zerlegebetrieb and Others, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A38&locale=en"

It should also be noted that the irregularity ended on 30 September 2007, which is the date on which the last project of the Sixth Framework Programme in which Zenon was active (namely Gnosys) ended. It is appropriate to consider that the alleged irregularity ceased on that date. It follows that the limitation period began to run only from 1 October 2007.</p>

The applicant acknowledged, at the hearing, having been informed of the investigation in a letter of July 2011. It should also be noted that the letter stated that the applicant was considered a ‘person concerned’ by the investigation in question and that he had been in contact with OLAF representatives, since there was a reference to the applicant’s email of 6 July 2011 to OLAF, in which he confirmed his agreement to the date of the hearing at his usual residence in Greece. In those circumstances, it must be held that the letter sent in July 2011 to the applicant interrupted the limitation period and caused a new period of four years to start running from the date of the letter (see, to that effect and by analogy, judgment of 13 March 2003 in José Martí Peix v Commission, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AT%3A2003%3A72&locale=en"

In the present case, the contracts concluded for the implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme concerned the period between 2002 and 2006 and thus extended over several years. Moreover, the irregularity noted by the Commission was continuous and extended over that period. The applicant cannot therefore claim that OLAF conducted an investigation over a period going back several years. Furthermore, OLAF complied with Article 6(5) of Regulation No 1073/1999, since the investigation was conducted continuously over a period which was proportional to the circumstances and complexity of the case. OLAF opened its investigation in December 2009. In February 2010, it carried out an inspection at Comeng’s premises. In August 2010, the Commission drafted the final audit report and sent it to Zenon who commented on it in October and November 2010. The Commission adopted the final audit report in February 2011. On the basis of the elements in the final audit report, OLAF, in July 2011, informed the applicant that he was a person concerned, interviewed him in September 2011, closed its investigation in September 2012 and sent its final investigation report to the Greek authorities in October 2012. It follows that OLAF did not infringe the obligation to conduct administrative procedures within a reasonable time or the right to good administration of which the obligation is a component. Similarly, in the light of the above, OLAF has not in any way infringed the principle of diligence.</p>

That principle requires that any person who may be adversely affected by the adoption of a decision must be placed in a position in which he may effectively make known his views on the evidence against him which the Commission has taken as the basis for the decision (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 October 1996 in Commission v Lisrestal and Others, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1996%3A402&locale=en"

However, the applicant has not demonstrated the existence of any causal link between that infringement and the damage complained of. He has not submitted any argument making it possible to understand how, in the present case, late notification informing the data protection officer of the processing of personal data undermined his reputation and led him to cease his business activities and interrupt his academic activities. Nor did he explain how the late notification caused him any non-pecuniary loss. Accordingly, inasmuch as it is based on the above infringement, the claim for damages must be dismissed as unfounded.</p>
