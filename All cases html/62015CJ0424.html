It is important that [NRAs] responsible for ex-ante market regulation should have their own budget allowing them, in particular, to recruit a sufficient number of qualified staff.

That court states, in that regard, that such reform and the ensuing dismissals may be covered by the freedom enjoyed by Member States to choose the form their NRA is to take. However, the fact that that reform entailed the early removal from office of the board members previously appointed, even though none of the grounds for dismissal expressly provided for in Article 16 of Law 2/2011 were made out, and the fact that no transitional measures were in place under which it would have been possible for the terms of office to be curtailed, may, in that court’s view, be considered to be at odds with the requirement for NRAs to be independent laid down in Article 3(2) and (3a) of the Framework Directive.</p>
