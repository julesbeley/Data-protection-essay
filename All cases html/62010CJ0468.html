         of personal data and on the free movement of such data is not limited to minimal harmonisation but amounts to harmonisation
         that is, in principle, complete. It is upon that view that the directive is intended to ensure free movement of personal data
         while guaranteeing a high level of protection for the rights and interests of the individuals to whom such data relate. Consequently,
         it follows from that objective that Article 7 of the directive sets out an exhaustive, restrictive list of cases in which
         the processing of personal data may be regarded as being lawful. It follows that Member States cannot add new principles relating
         to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data to Article 7 of that directive or impose additional requirements that
         have the effect of altering the scope of one of the principles provided for in Article 7.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">That interpretation is not brought into question by the right of Member States under Article 5 of Directive&nbsp;95/46 to specify
         the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. Indeed, Member States may not, by virtue of their discretion
         under Article&nbsp;5 of the directive, introduce principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data other
         than those listed in Article 7 of the directive, nor may they alter, by additional requirements, the extent of the principles
         provided for in Article 7.

      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point2">2.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;7(f) of Directive 95/46 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
         free movement of such data must be interpreted as precluding national rules which, in the absence of the data subject&#8217;s consent,
         and in order to allow such processing of that data subject&#8217;s personal data as is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest
         of the data controller or of the third party or parties to whom those data are disclosed, require, in addition to respect
         for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, that those data should also appear in public sources, thereby
         excluding, in a categorical, generalised way, any processing of data not appearing in such sources.
      </P>
      <P class="S01PointAltN">On the one hand, it follows from the objective of the directive of ensuring free movement of personal data while guaranteeing
         a high level of protection for the rights and interests of the individuals to whom such data relate that Article&nbsp;7 thereof
         sets out an exhaustive and restrictive list of cases in which the processing of personal data can be regarded as being lawful.
         Consequently, Member States may not add new principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data or impose
         additional requirements that have the effect of amending the scope of one of the principles provided for in Article 7. Nor,
         under Article 5 of the directive, may Member States introduce principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal
         data other than those listed in Article 7, or alter, by additional requirements, the scope of the principles provided for
         in Article 7.
      </P>
      <P class="S01PointAltN">On the other hand, in order to carry out the necessary balancing of the opposing rights and interests, provided for in Article&nbsp;7(f)
         of the directive, Member States may establish guidelines. They may take into consideration too the fact that the seriousness
         of the infringement of the data subject&#8217;s fundamental rights resulting from that processing can vary depending on whether
         or not the data in question already appear in public sources. In the latter case, the infringement will be more serious.
      </P>
      <P class="S01PointAltN">However, it is no longer a mere clarification, but an additional requirement precluded by Article&nbsp;7(f) of the directive if
         national rules exclude the possibility of processing certain categories of personal data by definitively prescribing, for
         those categories, the result of the balancing of the opposing rights and interests, without allowing a different result by
         virtue of the particular circumstances of an individual case.

         of such data, includes rules having a degree of flexibility and, in many instances, leaves to the Member States the task of
         deciding the details or choosing between options. A distinction, consequently, must be made between national measures that
         provide for additional requirements amending the scope of a principle referred to in Article 7 of the directive, on the one
         hand, and national measures which provide for a mere clarification of one of those principles, on the other hand. The first
         type of national measure is precluded. It is only in the context of the second type of national measure that Member States
         enjoy some latitude, pursuant to Article 5 of the directive.

         to be lawful, namely: first, the processing of the personal data must be necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
         pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed and, secondly, such interests must
         not be overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The second of those conditions necessitates
         a balancing of the opposing rights and interests concerned which depends, in principle, on the individual circumstances of
         the particular case in question and in the context of which the person or the institution which carries out the balancing
         must take account of the significance of the data subject&#8217;s rights arising from Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental
         Rights of the European Union.

         implement that directive in domestic law by the end of the period prescribed or where it has failed to implement that directive
         correctly. That is the case with Article&nbsp;7(f) of Directive 95/46 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing
         of personal data and on the free movement of such data. While that directive confers on the Member States a greater or lesser
         discretion in the implementation of some of its provisions, Article 7(f) states an unconditional obligation.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point27">27</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to recital 7 in the preamble to Directive 95/46, the establishment and functioning of the internal market are liable

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point28">28</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, it must be noted that Directive 95/46 is intended, as appears from, inter alia, recital 8 in the preamble
         thereto, to ensure that the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of
         personal data is equivalent in all Member States. Recital 10 adds that the approximation of the national laws applicable in
         this area must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high
         level of protection in the EU (see, to that effect, <I>Lindqvist</I>, paragraph 95, and <I>Huber</I>, paragraph 50).

         of personal data while guaranteeing a high level of protection for the rights and interests of the individuals to whom such

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point30">30</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it follows from the objective of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in all Member States that Article

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point32">32</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that Member States cannot add new principles relating to the lawfulness of the processing of personal data to Article
         7 of Directive 95/46 or impose additional requirements that have the effect of amending the scope of one of the six principles
         provided for in Article 7.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point33">33</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing interpretation is not brought into question by Article 5 of Directive&nbsp;95/46. Article 5 merely authorises Member
         States to specify, within the limits of Chapter II of that directive and, accordingly, Article 7 thereof, the conditions under
         which the processing of personal data is lawful.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point34">34</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The margin of discretion which Member States have pursuant to Article&nbsp;5 can therefore be used only in accordance with the

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directive 95/46 includes rules with a degree of flexibility and, in many instances, leaves to the Member States the task of
         deciding the details or choosing between options (<I>Lindqvist</I>, paragraph 83). A distinction, consequently, must be made between national measures that provide for additional requirements
         amending the scope of a principle referred to in Article 7 of Directive 95/46, on the one hand, and national measures which
         provide for a mere clarification of one of those principles, on the other hand. The first type of national measure is precluded.
         It is only in the context of the second type of national measure that Member States have, pursuant to Article 5 of Directive

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point38">38</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 7(f) sets out two cumulative conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the processing of personal data to be

         by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; and, secondly, such interests must not

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point39">39</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows that, in relation to the processing of personal data, Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 precludes any national rules

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point40">40</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, account must be taken of the fact that the second of those conditions necessitates a balancing of the opposing rights
         and interests concerned which depends, in principle, on the individual circumstances of the particular case in question and
         in the context of which the person or the institution which carries out the balancing must take account of the significance
         of the data subject&#8217;s rights arising from Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (&#8216;the
         Charter&#8217;). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point41">41</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it must be noted that Article 8(1) of the Charter states that &#8216;[e]veryone has the right to the protection
         of personal data concerning him or her&#8217;. That fundamental right is closely connected with the right to respect for private
         life expressed in Article 7 of the Charter (Joined Cases C&#8209;92/09 and C&#8209;93/09 <I>Volker und Markus Schecke and Eifert </I>[2010] ECR I&#8209;0000, paragraph 47).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Court&#8217;s case-law, the right to respect for private life with regard to the processing of personal data, recognised

         may be imposed on that right. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Member States must, when transposing Directive 95/46, take care to rely on an interpretation of that directive which
         allows a fair balance to be struck between the various fundamental rights and freedoms protected by the EU legal order (see,
         by analogy, Case C&#8209;275/06 <I>Promusicae</I> [2008] ECR I&#8209;271, paragraph&nbsp;68).

         the fact that the seriousness of the infringement of the data subject&#8217;s fundamental rights resulting from that processing
         can vary depending on whether or not the data in question already appear in public sources.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the processing of data appearing in public sources, the processing of data appearing in non-public sources necessarily
         implies that information relating to the data subject&#8217;s private life will thereafter be known by the data controller and,
         as the case may be, by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed. This more serious infringement of the data
         subject&#8217;s rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter must be properly taken into account by being balanced against
         the legitimate interest pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it must be noted that there is nothing to preclude Member States, in the exercise of their discretion laid

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is no longer a precision within the meaning of Article 5 of Directive&nbsp;95/46 if national rules exclude the possibility
         of processing certain categories of personal data by definitively prescribing, for those categories, the result of the balancing
         of the opposing rights and interests, without allowing a different result by virtue of the particular circumstances of an

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, without prejudice to Article 8 of Directive 95/46 concerning the processing of particular categories of data,

         in a categorical and generalised manner, the possibility of processing certain categories of personal data, without allowing
         the opposing rights and interests at issue to be balanced against each other in a particular case. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of those considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 must be interpreted
         as precluding national rules which, in the absence of the data subject&#8217;s consent, and in order to allow such processing of
         that data subject&#8217;s personal data as is necessary to pursue a legitimate interest of the data controller or of the third party
         or parties to whom those data are disclosed, require not only that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
         be respected, but also that those data should appear in public sources, thereby excluding, in a categorical and generalised
         way, any processing of data not appearing in such sources.
      </P>
      <P class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<I>The second question</I></P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its second question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 has direct effect.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it must be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, whenever the provisions of a directive
         appear, so far as their subject-matter is concerned, to be unconditional and sufficiently precise, they may be relied on before
         the national courts by individuals against the State where the latter has failed to implement that directive in domestic law
         by the end of the period prescribed or where it has failed to implement that directive correctly (see Case C&#8209;203/10 <I>Auto Nikolovi </I>[2011] ECR I&#8209;0000, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited). 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be stated that Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 is a provision that is sufficiently precise to be relied on by an individual
         and applied by the national courts. Moreover, while that directive undoubtedly confers on the Member States a greater or lesser
         discretion in the implementation of some of its provisions, Article 7(f), for its part, states an unconditional obligation
         (see, by analogy, <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others</I>, paragraph 100).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the expression &#8216;except where&#8217; in the actual text of Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 is not such, by itself, as
         to cast doubt on the unconditional nature of that provision, within the meaning of that case-law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That expression is intended to establish one of the two cumulative elements provided for in Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46
         to which the possibility of processing personal data without the data subject&#8217;s consent is subject. As that element is defined,
         it does not deprive Article 7(f) of its precise and unconditional nature.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second question is therefore that Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46 has direct effect.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point56">56</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the actions pending before the national court,
         the decisions on costs are a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the
         costs of those parties, are not recoverable.

      <P class="C41DispositifIntroduction">On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules:</P>
