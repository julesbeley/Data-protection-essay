      <P class="S01PointAltN"><A NAME="point1">1.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents,
         which provides for an exception to access to a document where disclosure would undermine the protection of privacy and the
         integrity of the individual, in particular in accordance with EU legislation regarding the protection of personal data, establishes
         a specific and reinforced system of protection of a person whose personal data could, in certain cases, be communicated to
         the public. That provision is indivisible and requires that any undermining of privacy and the integrity of the individual
         must always be examined and assessed in conformity with that legislation, and in particular with Regulation No 45/2001 on
         the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and
         on the free movement of such data.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">Whilst, according to Article 1(1) of Regulation No 45/2001, the purpose of that regulation is to &#8216;protect the fundamental
         rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal
         data&#8217;, that provision does not allow cases of processing of personal data to be separated into two categories, namely a category
         in which that treatment is examined solely on the basis of Article 8 of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the
         case-law of the European Court of Human Rights relating to that article and another category in which that processing is subject
         to the provisions of Regulation No 45/2001. In that regard, whilst it is clear from the first sentence of recital 15 of Regulation
         No 45/2001 that the Union legislature has pointed to the need to apply Article 6 EU and, by that means, Article 8 of the ECHR,
         where such processing is carried out by Community institutions or bodies in the exercise of activities falling outside the
         scope of that regulation, in particular those laid down in Titles V and VI of the EU Treaty in its version prior to the Treaty
         of Lisbon, such a reference has not been found necessary for processing carried out in the exercise of activities within the
         scope of that regulation, given that, in such cases, it is clearly Regulation No 45/2001 itself which applies.
      </P>
      <P class="S19Marge1">It follows that, where a request based on Regulation No 1049/2001 seeks to obtain access to documents including personal data,
         the provisions of Regulation No 45/2001 become applicable in their entirety, including Articles 8 and 18 thereof, which constitute
         essential provisions of the system of protection established by that regulation.

      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">&#8216;15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Bavarian Lager] was established on 28&nbsp;May 1992 for the importation of German beer for public houses and bars in the United
         Kingdom, situated primarily in the North of England.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Bavarian Lager was not able to sell its product, since a large number of publicans in the United Kingdom were tied
         by exclusive purchasing contracts obliging them to obtain their supplies of beer from certain breweries.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) Order 1989 SI 1989/2390, British breweries holding rights in more than 2&nbsp;000 pubs are
         required to allow the managers of those establishments the possibility of buying a beer from another brewery, on condition,
         according to Article&nbsp;7(2)(a) of the order, that it is conditioned in a cask and has an alcohol content exceeding 1.2% by volume.
         That provision is commonly known as the &#8220;Guest Beer Provision&#8221; (&#8220;the GBP&#8221;). 
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most beers produced outside the United Kingdom cannot be regarded as &#8220;cask-conditioned beers&#8221;, within the meaning

      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the GBP constituted a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on imports, and was
         thus incompatible with Article&nbsp;30 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article&nbsp;28 EC), [Bavarian Lager] lodged a complaint
         with the Commission by letter of 3&nbsp;April 1993, registered under reference P/93/4490/UK. 
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following its investigation, the Commission decided, on 12&nbsp;April 1995, to institute proceedings against the United Kingdom
         of Great Britain and Northern Ireland under Article&nbsp;169 of the EC Treaty (now Article&nbsp;226 EC). It notified the applicant on
         28&nbsp;September 1995 of that investigation and of the fact that it had sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom on
         15&nbsp;September 1995. On 26&nbsp;June 1996, the Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to the United Kingdom and, on 5&nbsp;August

         and representatives of the Confederation des Brasseurs du Marche Commun (&#8220;CBMC&#8221;). [Bavarian Lager] had requested the right
         to attend the meeting [of 11 October 1996] in a letter dated 27&nbsp;August 1996, but the Commission refused to grant permission

      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15&nbsp;March 1997 the Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom announced a proposal to amend the GBP under which
         a bottle-conditioned beer could be sold as a guest beer, as well as cask-conditioned beer. After the Commission had, on two
         occasions, namely 19&nbsp;March 1997 and 26&nbsp;June 1997, suspended its decision to issue a reasoned opinion to the United Kingdom,
         the head of Unit 2 &#8220;Application of Articles&nbsp;30 to 36 of the EC Treaty (notification, complaints, infringements etc.) and removal
         of trade barriers&#8221; of Directorate B &#8220;Free movement of goods and public procurement&#8221; of DG &#8220;Internal Market and Financial Services&#8221;,
         in a letter of 21&nbsp;April 1997, informed [Bavarian Lager] that, in view of the proposed amendment of the GBP, the Article&nbsp;169
         procedure had been suspended and the reasoned opinion had not been served on the United Kingdom Government. He indicated that
         the procedure would be discontinued entirely as soon as the amended GBP came into force. The new version of the GBP became
         applicable on 22&nbsp;August 1997. Consequently, the reasoned opinion was never sent to the United Kingdom and the Commission finally
         decided on 10&nbsp;December 1997 to take no further action in the infringement procedure.

         allowing a Member State to comply voluntarily with the requirements of the Treaty, or, where necessary, to give it the opportunity
         to justify its position, justified, for the protection of the public interest, the refusal of access to a preparatory document

      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4&nbsp;May 1998, [Bavarian Lager] addressed a request to the Commission under the Code of Conduct for access to all of the submissions
         made under file reference P/93/4490/UK by 11 named companies and organisations and by three defined categories of person or
         company. The Commission refused the initial application on the ground that the [said] Code of Conduct applies only to documents
         of which the Commission is the author. The confirmatory application was rejected on the grounds that the Commission was not
         the author of the document in question and that any application had to be sent to the author.

      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8&nbsp;July 1998, [Bavarian Lager] complained to the European Ombudsman under reference 713/98/IJH, stating, by letter dated
         2&nbsp;February 1999, that it wished to obtain the names of the delegates of the CBMC who had attended the meeting on 11&nbsp;October
         1996 and the names of the companies and any persons who fell into one of the 14 categories identified in the original request

      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following an exchange of letters between the Ombudsman and the Commission, the latter indicated to the Ombudsman in October

         identities to [Bavarian Lager], 20 replies had been received, of which 14 were positive and 6 were negative. The Commission
         supplied the names and addresses of those that had responded positively. [Bavarian Lager] stated to the Ombudsman that the

      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By e-mail of 5&nbsp;December 2003, [Bavarian Lager] sent a request to the Commission for access to the documents referred to in
         paragraph 26 above, based on Regulation No 1049/2001. 
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission replied to that request by letter of 27&nbsp;January 2004 stating that certain documents relating to the meeting
         [of 11 October 1996] could be disclosed, but drawing [Bavarian Lager&#8217;s] attention to the fact that five names had been blanked
         out from the minutes of the meeting of 11&nbsp;October 1996, following two express refusals by persons to consent to the disclosure
         of their identity and the Commission&#8217;s failure to contact the remaining three attendees. 
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By e-mail of 9&nbsp;February 2004, [Bavarian Lager] made a confirmatory application within the meaning of Article&nbsp;7(2) of Regulation
         No 1049/2001, in which it requested the full minutes of the meeting of 11&nbsp;October 1996, including all of the names. 
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By [the contested decision], the Commission rejected the confirmatory application of [Bavarian Lager]. It confirmed that Regulation
         No 45/2001 applied to the request for disclosure of the names of the other participants. As [Bavarian Lager] had not established
         an express and legitimate purpose or need for such a disclosure, the conditions set out by Article&nbsp;8 of that regulation had
         not been met and the exception provided for in Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 applied. It added that, even if
         the rules on the protection of personal data did not apply, it would nevertheless have had to refuse to disclose the other
         names under Article&nbsp;4(2), third indent, of Regulation No 1049/2001 so as not to compromise its ability to conduct inquiries.&#8217;

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point21">21</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding access to the full minutes of the meeting of 11 October 1996, the General Court took the view, in paragraphs 90
         to 95 of the judgment under appeal, that Bavarian Lager&#8217;s request was based on Regulation No 1049/2001. Whilst pointing out
         that, according to Article&nbsp;6(1) of Regulation No 1049/2001, a person requesting access is not required to justify his request
         and therefore does not have to demonstrate any interest in having access to the documents requested, the Court examined the
         exception to communication laid down in Article 4(1)(b) of that regulation, where disclosure of such a document might undermine
         the protection of privacy and the integrity of the individual.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point22">22</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraphs 96 to 119 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined the relationship between Regulations Nos
         45/2001 and 1049/2001. While stating that recital 15 of Regulation No 45/2001 indicates that access to documents, including
         those containing personal data, is governed by Article 255 EC, the Court emphasised that, according to recital 11 of Regulation
         No 1049/2001, in assessing the need for an exception, the institutions should take account of the principles in Community
         legislation concerning the protection of personal data in all areas of activity of the Union, thus including principles laid
         down in Regulation No 45/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point23">23</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the definitions of &#8216;personal data&#8217; and &#8216;processing of personal data&#8217; mentioned in Article 2(a) and (b) of Regulation
         No 45/2001, in paragraph 105 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court concluded that communication of data, by transmission,
         dissemination or otherwise making available, falls within the definition of &#8216;processing&#8217;, and thus Regulation No 45/2001 itself
         provides, independently of Regulation No 1049/2001, for the possibility of making certain personal data public.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point24">24</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 106 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that the processing of personal data must be lawful
         under Article&nbsp;5(a) or (b) of Regulation No 45/2001, according to which the processing must be necessary for the performance
         of a task carried out in the public interest or for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
         The Court then pointed out that the right of access to documents of the institutions recognised to citizens of the European
         Union and to any natural or legal person residing in or having its registered office in a Member State, laid down by Article&nbsp;2
         of Regulation No 1049/2001, constitutes a legal obligation for the purposes of Article&nbsp;5(b) of Regulation No 45/2001. Therefore,
         if Regulation No 1049/2001 requires the communication of data, which constitutes &#8216;processing&#8217; within the meaning of Article&nbsp;2(b)
         of Regulation No 45/2001, Article&nbsp;5 of that same regulation makes such communication lawful in that respect.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point25">25</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruling on the question of the obligation to prove the need to transfer, laid down by Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001,
         and of the data subject&#8217;s right to object pursuant to Article 18 of that regulation, the General Court held, in particular,
         in paragraphs 107 to 109 of the judgment under appeal, as follows:
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the obligation to prove the need to transfer, laid down by Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, it should be
         remembered that access to documents containing personal data falls within the application of Regulation No 1049/2001, and
         that, according to Article&nbsp;6(1) of the latter, a person requesting access is not required to justify his request and therefore
         does not have to demonstrate any interest in having access to the documents requested &#8230; Therefore, where personal data are
         transferred in order to give effect to Article&nbsp;2 of Regulation No 1049/2001, laying down the right of access to documents
         for all citizens of the Union, the situation falls within the application of that regulation and, therefore, the applicant
         does not need to prove the necessity of disclosure for the purposes of Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001. If one were
         to require the applicant to demonstrate the necessity of having the data transferred, as an additional condition imposed in
         Regulation No 45/2001, that requirement would be contrary to the objective of Regulation No 1049/2001, namely the widest possible
         public access to documents held by the institutions. 
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, given that access to a document will be refused under Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 where disclosure
         would undermine protection of the privacy and the integrity of the individual, a transfer that does not fall under that exception
         cannot, in principle, prejudice the legitimate interests of the person concerned within the meaning of Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation
         No 45/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C09Marge0avecretrait">109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the data subject&#8217;s right to object, Article&nbsp;18 of Regulation No 45/2001 provides that that person has the right
         to object at any time, on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to the processing of
         data relating to him or her, except in cases covered by, in particular, Article&nbsp;5(b) of that regulation. Therefore, given
         that the processing envisaged by Regulation No 1049/2001 constitutes a legal obligation for the purposes of Article&nbsp;5(b) of
         Regulation No 45/2001, the data subject does not, in principle, have a right to object. However, since Article 4(1)(b) of
         Regulation No 1049/2001 lays down an exception to that legal obligation, it is necessary to take into account, on that basis,
         the impact of the disclosure of data concerning the data subject.&#8217;
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point26">26</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the General Court held that the exception under Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 had to be interpreted
         restrictively and concerned only personal data that were capable of actually and specifically undermining the protection of
         privacy and the integrity of the individual. Examination as to whether a person&#8217;s private life might be undermined had to
         be carried out in the light of Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point42">42</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission, supported by the United Kingdom and the Council, argues in essence that the General Court made errors of law

         certain provisions of Regulation No 45/2001 ineffective.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point43">43</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission considers that the General Court ruled without reference to the second part of the sentence in Article 4(1)(b)

         the protection of privacy and the integrity of the individual, &#8216;in particular in accordance with Community legislation regarding
         the protection of personal data&#8217;. The General Court interpreted the exception laid down in Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point44">44</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That erroneous interpretation of the exception laid down by the said Article 4(1)(b) had the consequence of rendering ineffective

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point45">45</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely, the Commission argues, by giving precedence to Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1049/2001, which provides that,
         in the context of requests from the public for access to documents, the applicant is not obliged to state reasons for the
         application, that the General Court renders ineffective Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, which requires the recipient
         of a transfer of personal data to demonstrate the need for their disclosure.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point46">46</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obligation on a recipient of a transfer of personal data to demonstrate that a legitimate purpose is being pursued, contained
         in Article 8(b) of Regulation 45/2001 is, the Commission submits, one of the key provisions of the whole of the Union legislation
         concerning data protection. Thus, communication of personal data appearing in a document held by an institution constitutes
         not only public access to a document under Regulation No 1049/2001, but also a processing of personal data under Regulation
         No 45/2001, which the General Court did not take into account.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission adds that the General Court, in holding that any request for personal data must comply with the legal obligation
         arising from the right of public access, within the meaning of Article 5(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, renders devoid of purpose
         Article 18(a) of that regulation, which confers on the data subject the right to object at any time, on compelling legitimate
         grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to the processing of data relating to him or her.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point48">48</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the General Court devotes a significant part of its reasoning, and in particular paragraphs 96 to

         121 to 139 of that judgment, the criteria which it inferred therefrom to this case.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the General Court rightly states in paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal, when examining the relationship between

         to the case in point, it must be borne in mind that those regulations have different objectives. The first is designed to
         ensure the greatest possible transparency of the decision-making process of the public authorities and the information on
         which they base their decisions. It is thus designed to facilitate as far as possible the exercise of the right of access
         to documents, and to promote good administrative practices. The second is designed to ensure the protection of the freedoms
         and fundamental rights of individuals, particularly their private life, in the handling of personal data.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in recital 2 of Regulation No 45/2001, the Union legislature intended to establish a &#8216;fully-fledged system&#8217; of protection

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation No 1049/2001 lays down as a general rule that the public may have access to the documents of the institutions,

         states that, &#8216;[i]n assessing the exceptions, the institutions should take account of the principles in Community legislation

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point59">59</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be observed that, in acting in that way, the General Court disregards the wording of Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation

         or bodies in the exercise of activities falling outside the scope of this Regulation, in particular those laid down in Titles

         under appeal, the application of Article 18 of Regulation No 45/2001. And yet those articles constitute essential provisions

         containing the minutes of the meeting of 11 October 1996, with five names removed. Of those five names, three persons could
         not be contacted by the Commission in order to give their consent, and two others expressly objected to the disclosure of

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point68">68</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that, in paragraph 104 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, in examining Article 2(a) of Regulation

         2003, that procedure was in compliance with the requirements of Directive 95/46, in force at that time. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point74">74</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a new request by Bavarian Lager to the Commission, dated 5 December 2003, seeking communication of the full minutes
         of the meeting of 11 October 1996, the Commission informed Bavarian Lager on 27 January 2004 that, having regard to the entry
         into force of Regulations Nos&nbsp;45/2001 and 1049/2001, it was henceforward obliged to treat that request under the specific
         regime of those regulations, particularly Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point75">75</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether under the former system of Directive 95/46 or under the system of Regulations Nos 45/2001 and 1049/2001, the Commission
         was right to verify whether the data subjects had given their consent to the disclosure of personal data concerning them.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point76">76</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Court finds that, by releasing the expurgated version of the minutes of the meeting of 11 October 1996 with the names
         of five participants removed therefrom, the Commission did not infringe the provisions of Regulation No 1049/2001 and sufficiently
         complied with its duty of openness.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point77">77</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By requiring that, in respect of the five persons who had not given their express consent, Bavarian Lager establish the necessity
         for those personal data to be transferred, the Commission complied with the provisions of Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point78">78</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Bavarian Lager has not provided any express and legitimate justification or any convincing argument in order to demonstrate
         the necessity for those personal data to be transferred, the Commission has not been able to weigh up the various interests
         of the parties concerned. Nor was it able to verify whether there was any reason to assume that the data subjects&#8217; legitimate
         interests might be prejudiced, as required by Article 8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point79">79</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the above that the Commission was right to reject the application for access to the full minutes of the meeting
         of 11 October 1996.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point80">80</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the General Court erred in law in concluding, in paragraphs 133 and 139 of the judgment under appeal, that in this
         case the Commission had wrongly applied Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 and held that Bavarian Lager had not established
         either an express and legitimate purpose in obtaining, or any need to obtain, the document at issue in its entirety. 
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point81">81</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of those considerations as a whole, it is appropriate, without there being any need to examine the other arguments
         and pleas of the parties, to set aside the judgment under appeal in so far as it annuls the contested decision.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point83">83</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the case here.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point84">84</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Court has found in paragraphs 69 and 73 of this judgment, the contested decision did not infringe the provisions of

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point85">85</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action for annulment by Bavarian Lager against that decision must therefore be dismissed.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point86">86</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 122 of the Rules of Procedure, where the appeal is well founded and the Court of
         Justice itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to costs. Under Article 69(2) of those
         rules, which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay
         the costs, if they have been applied for in the successful party&#8217;s pleadings. Under Article 69(4) of those rules, which applies
         to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 thereof, Member States and institutions which intervene in the proceedings
         are to bear their own costs. The Court may order an intervener to bear its own costs.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point87">87</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Commission has applied for costs and Bavarian Lager has been unsuccessful in the appeal, Bavarian Lager must be

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point88">88</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Commission has also applied for an order that Bavarian Lager pay the costs of the procedure before the General Court

         at first instance.
