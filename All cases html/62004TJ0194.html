         must be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or for compliance with a legal obligation

         State are entitled, laid down by Article&nbsp;2 of Regulation No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council
         and Commission documents, constitutes a legal obligation for the purposes of Article&nbsp;5(b) of Regulation No 45/2001. Therefore,

         is not required to justify his request and therefore does not have to demonstrate any interest in having access to the documents
         requested. Therefore, where personal data are transferred in order to give effect to Article&nbsp;2 of Regulation No 1049/2001,
         laying down the right of access to documents for all citizens of the Union, the situation falls within the application of
         that regulation and, therefore, the applicant does not need to prove the necessity of disclosure for the purposes of Article&nbsp;8(b)
         of Regulation No 45/2001 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community
         institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data. If one were to require the applicant to demonstrate the necessity
         of having the data transferred, as an additional condition imposed in Regulation No 45/2001, that requirement would be contrary
         to the objective of Regulation No 1049/2001, namely the widest possible public access to documents held by the institutions.

         to him or her, except in cases covered by, in particular, Article&nbsp;5(b) of that regulation. Therefore, given that the processing

         a legal obligation for the purposes of Article&nbsp;5(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, the data subject does not, in principle, have
         a right to object. However, since Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 lays down an exception to that legal obligation,
         it is necessary to take into account, on that basis, the impact of the disclosure of data concerning the data subject. In
         that regard, if communication of those data would not undermine protection of the privacy and the integrity of the individual
         concerned, as required by Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001, that person&#8217;s objection cannot prevent such communication.

         No 1049/2001 determines the general principles and the limits which, for reasons of public or private interest, govern the

         provides an exception designed to ensure protection of the privacy and integrity of the individual. Since exceptions to the

         recital 33 of Directive 95/46 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
         movement of such data, reference is made to data which are capable by their nature of infringing fundamental freedoms or privacy
         and which should not be processed unless the data subject gives his explicit consent, which implies that not all data are
         of that nature. Such sensitive data may be included in those referred to by Article 10 of Regulation No 45/2001 on the protection
         of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement

         the name of which and on behalf of which those persons attended, described by their title, the initial of their forename,
         their surname and, where relevant, the service, department or association to which they belong within those bodies, contains

         processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data, since the persons

         for access under Regulation No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents
         contains personal data does not necessarily mean that the privacy or integrity of the persons concerned is affected, even

         concerned in a list of participants at a meeting, on behalf of the body which that person represented, does not constitute

         of the documents in question risks jeopardising the completion of the inspections, investigations or audits. That exception,
         from the way in which it is formulated, is designed not to protect investigations as such but the purpose of those investigations,

         failure to fulfil obligations was adopted, no investigation whose purpose could have been jeopardised by disclosure of the
         minutes containing the names of certain representatives of bodies which participated in the meeting was in progress, with
         the result that the exception under the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001 cannot be applied.

         document concerns an interest protected by an exception is not sufficient to justify that exception being applied. Secondly,
         the risk of a protected interest being affected must be reasonably foreseeable and not merely hypothetical. Therefore, the
         assessment which the institution must undertake in order to apply an exception must be carried out in a concrete way and be

      <P class="S02AlineaAltA">Thus, whilst the need to preserve the anonymity of persons providing the Commission with information on possible infringements

         partial, access to certain documents, the fact remains that, in this case, the Commission ruled in the abstract on the effect
         which disclosure of the document concerned with names might have on its investigative activity, without demonstrating to a
         sufficient legal standard that disclosure of that document would actually and specifically undermine protection of the purposes
         of investigations. Thus it has not been shown in this case that the purpose of investigations was actually and specifically
         jeopardised by the disclosure of data requested six years after the closure of those investigations.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point15">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant was established on 28&nbsp;May 1992 for the importation of German beer for public houses and bars in the United Kingdom,
         situated primarily in the North of England.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point16">16</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the applicant was not able to sell its product, since a large number of publicans in the United Kingdom were tied
         by exclusive purchasing contracts obliging them to obtain their supplies of beer from certain breweries.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point17">17</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) Order 1989 SI 1989/2390, British breweries holding rights in more than 2&nbsp;000 pubs are
         required to allow the managers of those establishments the possibility of buying a beer from another brewery, on condition,
         according to Article&nbsp;7(2)(a) of the order, that it is conditioned in a cask and has an alcohol content exceeding 1.2&nbsp;% by
         volume. That provision is commonly known as the &#8216;Guest Beer Provision&#8217; (&#8216;the GBP&#8217;).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point18">18</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most beers produced outside the United Kingdom cannot be regarded as &#8216;cask-conditioned beers&#8217;, within the meaning

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point19">19</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the GBP constituted a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on imports, and was

         with the Commission by letter of 3&nbsp;April 1993, registered under reference P/93/4490/UK.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point20">20</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following its investigation, the Commission decided, on 12&nbsp;April 1995, to institute proceedings against the United Kingdom

         28&nbsp;September 1995 of that investigation and of the fact that it had sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom on
         15&nbsp;September 1995. On 26&nbsp;June 1996, the Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to the United Kingdom and, on 5&nbsp;August

         Department of Trade and Industry and representatives of the Confederation des Brasseurs du Marche Commun (&#8216;CBMC&#8217;). The applicant

         occasions, namely 19&nbsp;March 1997 and 26&nbsp;June 1997, suspended its decision to issue a reasoned opinion to the United Kingdom,
         the head of Unit 2 &#8216;Application of Articles&nbsp;30 to 36 of the EC Treaty (notification, complaints, infringements etc.) and removal

         in a letter of 21&nbsp;April 1997, informed the applicant that, in view of the proposed amendment of the GBP, the Article&nbsp;169 procedure
         had been suspended and the reasoned opinion had not been served on the United Kingdom Government. He indicated that the procedure
         would be discontinued entirely as soon as the amended GBP came into force. The new version of the GBP became applicable on
         22&nbsp;August 1997. Consequently, the reasoned opinion was never sent to the United Kingdom and the Commission finally decided

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point25">25</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant brought an action, registered as Case T&#8209;309/97, before the Court of First Instance against the decision of 18&nbsp;September

         namely allowing a Member State to comply voluntarily with the requirements of the Treaty, or, where necessary, to give it
         the opportunity to justify its position, justified, for the protection of the public interest, the refusal of access to a

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point26">26</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4&nbsp;May 1998, the applicant addressed a request to the Commission under the Code of Conduct for access to all of the submissions
         made under file reference P/93/4490/UK by 11 named companies and organisations and by three defined categories of person or
         company. The Commission refused the initial application on the ground that the Code of Conduct applies only to documents of
         which the Commission is the author. The confirmatory application was rejected on the grounds that the Commission was not the
         author of the document in question and that any application had to be sent to the author.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point27">27</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8&nbsp;July 1998, the applicant complained to the European Ombudsman under reference 713/98/IJH, stating, by letter dated 2&nbsp;February

         received no reply to its request for their consent because, in the absence of a reply, the interests and fundamental rights

      <P class="C02AlineaAltA">&#8216;data protection rules are being misinterpreted as implying the existence of a general right to participate anonymously in

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point34">34</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By e-mail of 5&nbsp;December 2003, the applicant sent a request to the Commission for access to the documents referred to in paragraph

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point35">35</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission replied to that request by letter of 27&nbsp;January 2004 stating that certain documents relating to the meeting
         could be disclosed, but drawing the applicant&#8217;s attention to the fact that five names had been blanked out from the minutes
         of the meeting of 11&nbsp;October 1996, following two express refusals by persons to consent to the disclosure of their identity
         and the Commission&#8217;s failure to contact the remaining three attendees.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point36">36</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By e-mail of 9&nbsp;February 2004, the applicant made a confirmatory application within the meaning of Article&nbsp;7(2) of Regulation

         It confirmed that Regulation No 45/2001 applied to the request for disclosure of the names of the other participants. As the
         applicant had not established an express and legitimate purpose or need for such a disclosure, the conditions set out by Article&nbsp;8
         of that regulation had not been met and the exception provided for in Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 applied.
         It added that, even if the rules on the protection of personal data did not apply, it would nevertheless have had to refuse
         to disclose the other names under Article&nbsp;4(2), third indent, of Regulation No 1049/2001 so as not to compromise its ability
         to conduct inquiries.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point47">47</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is settled case-law that the Court of First Instance is not entitled, when exercising judicial review of legality, to issue
         directions to the institutions or to assume the role assigned to them. That limitation of the scope of judicial review applies
         to all types of contentious matters that might be brought before it, including those concerning access to documents (Case

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point49">49</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant argues that the Commission agreed to close a procedure for failure to fulfil its obligations, in breach of Article&nbsp;30
         of the EC Treaty, or, alternatively, of Article&nbsp;6 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 12 EC), of which the meeting
         of 11&nbsp;October 1996 was a crucial component.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point50">50</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the Commission refused the applicant&#8217;s request to attend the meeting, that it wrongly settled the proceedings for
         failure to fulfil obligations, that the amended GBP continued to discriminate against beers from Member States other than
         the United Kingdom, and that the Commission showed extreme reluctance to reveal the names of those present at the meeting,
         that meeting must, the applicant argues, have been used as an opportunity for the United Kingdom Government and large United
         Kingdom beer producing companies to persuade the Commission to adopt an amendment that served to prevent beer importers such
         as the applicant from being able to sell their products to a sizeable portion of the United Kingdom market. That agreement,
         seeking to obtain unlawful closure of the procedure for failure to fulfil obligations, caused the applicant to suffer loss
         of opportunity and as a result, substantial financial loss. Therefore, it argues, there was a breach of Article&nbsp;30 of the
         EC Treaty.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point51">51</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant argues that the amended GBP is also contrary to Article&nbsp;6 of the EC Treaty in that its effect is to establish
         discrimination based on nationality against beers produced in Member States other than the United Kingdom.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point52">52</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission considers, essentially, that the applicant&#8217;s claims for a declaration that the Commission&#8217;s acceptance of the
         amendment made by the United Kingdom Government to the GBP was contrary to Article&nbsp;30 of the EC Treaty, that it should not
         have accepted that amendment, and that it thus infringed Article&nbsp;30 of the EC Treaty, are manifestly inadmissible.
      </P>
      <P class="C05Titre2">&nbsp;<I>Findings of the Court</I></P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point53">53</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant is requesting the Court to declare that the Commission&#8217;s acceptance of the amendment made by the United Kingdom
         Government to the GBP is contrary to Articles&nbsp;30 and 6 of the EC Treaty. That request should be interpreted, in reality, as
         an argument by the applicant that the Commission acted wrongly in deciding to take no further action on its complaint against
         measures of the United Kingdom allegedly contrary to Community law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point54">54</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it should be noted that private individuals are not entitled to bring proceedings against a refusal by the
         Commission to institute proceedings against a Member State for failure to fulfil its obligations (order of 12&nbsp;June 1992 in
         Case C&#8209;29/92 <I>Asia Motor France</I> v <I>Commission</I> [1992] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;3935, paragraph 21; order of 15&nbsp;March 2004 in Case T&#8209;139/02 <I>Institouto N.

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point55">55</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Article&nbsp;169 of the EC Treaty, the Commission is not bound to bring proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations, but
         has a discretionary power precluding the right of individuals to require it to adopt a particular position or to bring an
         action for annulment against its refusal to take action (order of 16&nbsp;February 1998 in Case T&#8209;182/97 <I>Smanor and Others</I> v <I>Commission</I> [1998] ECR&nbsp;II&#8209;271, paragraph 27, and <I>Institouto N.&nbsp;Avgerinopoulou and Others</I> v <I>Commission</I>, paragraph 77).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point56">56</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, therefore, the applicant has no standing to request the annulment of the Commission&#8217;s refusal to bring an action
         for failure to fulfil obligations against the United Kingdom on the ground that the amended GBP infringed Articles&nbsp;6 and 30
         of the EC Treaty. In those circumstances, the Commission cannot be accused of itself infringing those articles by taking no
         further action on the proceedings in question.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point57">57</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, even if the applicant&#8217;s request were interpreted as seeking annulment not of that refusal but of the decision
         to take no further action on its complaint of 10&nbsp;December 1997, it should be noted that a decision whereby the Commission
         decides to take no further action on a complaint informing it of conduct by a State capable of giving rise to proceedings
         for failure to fulfil obligations does not have binding force and is not therefore a measure that is open to challenge (order
         in <I>Aseprofar and Edifa </I>v <I>Commission</I>, paragraph 48). Moreover, the action would be clearly out of time, having regard to the date of that decision.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point58">58</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, the applicant&#8217;s claims concerning the decision to take no further action on its complaint are inadmissible.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point59">59</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, concerning the applicant&#8217;s claim that unlawful closure of the proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations caused
         it loss of opportunity and significant financial loss, it is sufficient to note that the applicant has not made a claim for
         compensation as part of its action. Therefore, there is no need to rule in that respect.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point60">60</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant submits that, in accordance with the conclusions drawn by the Ombudsman&#8217;s Special Report, the exception contained
         in Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 does not apply to this case, since Directive 95/46 does not oblige the Commission
         to withhold the names of persons who submit views or information to it. The applicant refers in that respect to the letter
         from the Ombudsman to the President of the Commission on 30&nbsp;September 2002, to complain about misuse of Directive 95/46.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point61">61</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, the applicant argues, does Article&nbsp;4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 apply. Given that the meeting took place in 1996,
         any potential undermining of the Commission&#8217;s decision-making process would be at best minimal, given that over seven years
         have passed since the holding of that meeting and the bringing of the action. Even if that provision did apply, the Commission
         could not rely on it to support its refusal to disclose the information requested, because of the overwhelming public interest
         in disclosure in this case. For example, the Ombudsman and the Parliament have taken a particular interest, in this case,
         in the high level of secrecy surrounding the way in which powerful third parties can make their views known to the Commission,
         which is contrary to the principles of open government.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point62">62</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its reply, the applicant argues that there is a new element in the defence, namely that the persons whose names the applicant
         requested were employees of the CBMC and had acted in accordance with the instructions of the body which they represented.
         The applicant argues that, since the Commission has revealed that those persons were representatives of the CBMC, that statement
         is now in the public domain, so that no further compromising of the Commission&#8217;s reputation for confidentiality would occur
         by disclosing their names.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point63">63</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant points out that trade associations, such as the CBMC, usually represent all or most of the participants in a
         market, and thus tend to expound views on behalf of an industry as a whole. The Commission&#8217;s reputation could be damaged only
         if it were to transpire that, at the meeting on 11&nbsp;October 1996, the CBMC representatives represented a specific group of
         brewers with an interest in maintaining foreclosure in the United Kingdom market for beer sold in pubs and bars. The applicant
         argues that, where the information providers are employees of such a trade association, there is no risk emanating from the
         loss of that confidentiality, unless the trade association is not accurately reflecting the views of all of its members.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point64">64</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant concludes that Article&nbsp;2 of Regulation No 1049/2001 obliges the Commission to make full disclosure of the attendees
         of the meeting and the submissions made with respect to the procedure for failure to fulfil obligations, and that none of
         the exceptions contained in Article&nbsp;4 of Regulation No 1049/2001 apply to this case.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point65">65</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDPS argued at the hearing that the Commission has infringed Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001. He refers in
         that regard to a document entitled &#8216;Public access to documents and data protection&#8217; (Reference documents, July 2005 No&nbsp;1,
         EDPS &#8211; European Data Protection Supervisor), which can be found on the EDPS internet site.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point66">66</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDPS stresses the need to establish an optimal balance between, on the one hand, the protection of data of a private nature,
         and, on the other, the fundamental right of the European citizen to have access to documents of the institutions. The Commission&#8217;s
         reasoning did not correctly take account of that balance, which is explicitly governed by Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No
         1049/2001. Since a request for access to documents is based on democratic principles, it is not necessary to state the reasons
         why the documents are requested, so that Article&nbsp;8 of Regulation No 45/2001 does not apply in this case. Similarly, the EDPS
         considers that data protection rules do not allow the inference of a general right to participate, anonymously, in public
         activities.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point67">67</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the EDPS, the interest protected in Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 is private life and not the protection
         of personal data, which is a much broader concept. Whilst the name of a participant, mentioned in the minutes of a meeting,
         falls within the scope of personal data, since the identity of that person would be revealed and the concept of the protection
         of personal data applies to those data, whether or not they fall within the scope of private life, the EDPS points out that,
         in the area of professional activities, the disclosure of a name does not normally have any link to private life. The EDPS
         concludes that the Commission cannot rely on Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 in order to refuse to disclose the
         names of the persons concerned.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point68">68</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDPS concludes that, in any case, on a proper interpretation of Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001, the right
         to refuse disclosure is not an absolute right, but implies that private life must be affected to an important or considerable
         extent, which must be assessed having regard to the rules and principles on the protection of personal data. No general right
         is conferred on the person concerned to oppose disclosure. A person concerned who opposes disclosure must put forward a plausible
         reason, explaining why disclosure might be harmful to him.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point69">69</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission argues that the application for annulment of the contested decision is unfounded. It notes that, in this case,
         what is at issue is the interaction of two rights, namely the right of the public to have access to documents and the right
         to the protection of private life and data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point70">70</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the right of public access to documents under Regulation No 1049/2001 is generally unrestricted and automatic
         and is not dependent on the demonstration of any special interest peculiar to the person requesting access. The person making
         the request is not normally obliged to state reasons justifying it.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point71">71</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, personal data may only be disclosed lawfully and legitimately according to the basic principles governing
         the right to privacy and the specific provisions governing the processing of personal data. The Commission refers to Article&nbsp;8
         of the ECHR, Article&nbsp;286 EC and Articles&nbsp;7 and 8 of the Charter. The provisions of Regulation No 45/2001 require that the
         person making a request for personal data must establish the necessity for disclosure of such data and the Commission must
         be satisfied that the data subject&#8217;s interests will not be prejudiced.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point72">72</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission notes that the applicant does not present any legal arguments in support of its contention that the exception
         of Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation 1049/2001, and subsequently Regulation No 45/2001, does not apply, but has merely relied
         on the Ombudsman&#8217;s draft recommendation and the resolution of the European Parliament supporting it. However the Ombudsman&#8217;s
         conclusion was based on an interpretation of Directive 95/46, and of the Code of Conduct, which was subsequently disproved
         by the Court (Case C&#8209;41/00 P <I>Interporc</I> v <I>Commission</I> [2003] ECR I&#8209;2125; Case T 92/98 <I>Interporc</I> v <I>Commission</I> [1999] ECR II&#8209;3521, paragraph 70; and Case T&#8209;47/01 <I>Co-Frutta</I> v <I>Commission</I> [2003] ECR II&#8209;4441, paragraphs 63 and 64). Since the applicant&#8217;s latest request for access was made after Regulations Nos
         45/2001 and 1049/2001 came into force, the Commission&#8217;s decision to withhold the names should be examined under those rules.
         In any event, the conclusive interpretation of the law is not within the remit of either the Ombudsman or the Parliament.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point73">73</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission argues that the Court has confirmed the position taken by the Commission with regard to the scope of the data
         protection rules. The Court has ruled that the data protection rules, and in particular the principle of proportionality,
         apply to the publication of individuals&#8217; names even when the individuals are public employees and the processing is for a
         public purpose (Joined Cases C&#8209;465/00, C&#8209;138/01 and C&#8209;139/01 <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer Rundfunk and Others</I> [2003] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;4989, paragraph 64). That approach, in relation to Directive 95/46, was subsequently confirmed by the Court
         in Case C&#8209;101/01 <I>Lindqvist</I> [2003] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;12971, paragraph 24, according to which the term &#8216;personal data&#8217; undoubtedly covers the name of a person in
         conjunction with his telephone number or information about his working conditions or hobbies.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point74">74</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission argues that the specific means to reconcile the rights of public access and of privacy and data protection
         is enshrined in Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001, which should be read in the light of recital 11 of that regulation,
         which explains that &#8216;[i]n assessing the exceptions, the institutions should take account of the principles in Community legislation
         concerning the protection of personal data, in all areas of Union activities&#8217;. That exception does not have to be balanced
         with any overriding public interest in disclosure, but specifically requires the Community institutions to refuse access to
         a document where disclosure would undermine the protection of privacy and the protection of personal data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point75">75</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation No 45/2001 does not preclude disclosure or other processing of personal data by the Commission, but provides the
         means of assessing on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis whether it is lawful and legitimate for an institution to process personal data,
         and hence whether such processing would not undermine data protection.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point76">76</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission argues that, where processing is lawful and legitimate under Regulation No 45/2001 in a particular case, the
         exception to the right of public access in Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 does not apply and a document containing
         personal data must be disclosed. Where, however, the processing requested is not lawful and legitimate and the applicant has
         been unable to demonstrate why disclosure is necessary, the Commission is not required to disclose those data.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point77">77</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since, the Commission argues, both rights are of the same nature, importance and degree, they have to be applied together,
         and, where a request is made for access to a public document containing personal data, a balance must be sought on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case
         basis.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point78">78</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission refers in that regard to a report on the situation of Fundamental Rights in the European Union and its Member
         States, drawn up in 2002 by the EU Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights, according to which &#8216;while taking
         into account the possibility of granting only partial access to certain documents, it is essential that the Community institution
         does not grant right of access to documents when the interests of the applicant do not have any reasonable relationship of
         proportionality with the resulting violation of the right of the person concerned to protect his privacy regarding the processing
         of personal data&#8217;.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point79">79</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for such a balanced approach has also been highlighted by the Data Protection Working Party established under Article&nbsp;29
         of Directive 95/46, in its Opinion 5/2001 of 17&nbsp;May 2001 on the European Ombudsman Special Report. According to that Opinion:
      </P>
      <P class="C02AlineaAltA">&#8216;It should be noted ... that the obligation to public disclosure imposed by the legislation on public access to administrative
         documents does not establish an absolute obligation of openness. It rather makes the obligation to grant access to documents
         subject to due regard being made of the right to privacy. Therefore, it does not justify unlimited or unfettered disclosure
         of personal data. On the contrary, a joint reading of legislation on public access and on data protection normally imposes
         that an analysis of the circumstances surrounding each situation is made on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis, in order to strike a balance
         between those two rights. In particular, as a result of such assessment, legislation on public access may provide for different
         rules to apply to different categories of data or different kinds of data subjects.&#8217;
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point80">80</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission points out that Regulation No 1049/2001 does not impose an automatic, unrestricted obligation to disclose documents
         or parts of documents containing personal data, but that that obligation exists only so far as it does not undermine the data
         protection rules.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point81">81</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the Commission took all the relevant circumstances into account. In the case of the representatives of UK authorities
         and of the CBMC, the applicant was fully informed of the interests and of the bodies represented at the meeting. As representatives,
         the persons present there were acting on instructions of the represented bodies in their capacity as employees of those bodies
         and not in a personal capacity. The effects of the decisions taken there applied to the represented bodies and not to the
         representatives in their personal capacity. It is therefore the information concerning the represented bodies that is relevant
         for the public scrutiny pursued by the principle of transparency, and the Commission&#8217;s refusal to disclose the names of the
         individuals representing those interests is, the Commission submits, not to be considered as a breach of the rights of the
         applicant. The Commission also took account of the need to protect its ability to carry out investigations and its sources
         of information.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point82">82</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission further argues that the applicant has never fulfilled the obligation to prove the need for a transfer of data,
         imposed by Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001. Disclosure of the names of the participants would not shed any additional
         light on the Commission&#8217;s decision to close the proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations. Since the minutes were disclosed,
         the public is fully aware of the facts and arguments on the basis of which the Commission took its decision. Thus, in the
         absence of a specific and valid reason demonstrating the need to disclose personal data to third parties, the Commission was
         therefore obliged to refuse to make such a disclosure.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point83">83</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Commission, contrary to what the applicant argues in its reply, the fact that the names of the staff of the
         CBMC are in the public domain does not mean that the identity of the staff who attended the meeting with the Commission must
         also be in the public domain. It does not follow that the names of the particular employees of a trade association who represented
         that association at a meeting can necessarily be deduced from the publication of the identities of all its staff. If that
         were the case, the applicant would have no reason to ask for these names to be revealed to it. Moreover, the applicant has
         not suggested that the representatives of the CBMC did not represent the views of the association at the meeting, or demonstrated
         how knowing the identities of the persons concerned would provide more necessary information than was concerned in the meeting
         report and the other documents which were disclosed.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point84">84</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the applicant&#8217;s arguments as to the alleged application of Article&nbsp;4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, the Commission
         stresses that it based its refusal to disclose the names not on the exception under that paragraph, but on that laid down
         by the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of that regulation.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point85">85</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant was informed that, even if the rules on data protection did not apply to the request, the Commission would have
         reasons to refuse to disclose the names of five persons against their will, in order to protect its ability to carry out investigations
         into possible infringements of Community law. The meeting of 11&nbsp;October 1996 took place in the context of such an investigation.
         If the names of persons who provided information to the Commission could be disclosed against their will, the Commission could
         be deprived of a valuable source of information, putting at risk its ability to carry out such investigations.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point86">86</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission argues that, under complaint and infringement procedures, complainants are given the possibility to choose
         between a &#8216;confidential&#8217; and a &#8216;non confidential&#8217; handling of their complaint, and that there are no good reasons why other
         parties interested in the infringement procedure should not enjoy the same right.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point87">87</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the exception mentioned in the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001 required the Commission not to
         disclose the five names to the applicant.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point88">88</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Commission argues that the applicant has not demonstrated any &#8216;overriding public interest in disclosure&#8217; of those
         remaining names so as to preclude the Commission from applying that exception.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point89">89</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the disclosure of the names of the other persons, against their will and contrary to their expectation of confidentiality
         when contributing to the investigation into the alleged infringement, would undermine the protection of all investigations.
         Therefore, the Commission argues, there is a manifest public interest in favour of preserving confidentiality in investigations
         rather than endangering it.

         either an express and legitimate purpose or the need for such disclosure, the conditions set out by Article&nbsp;8 of that regulation
         had not been met and the exception provided for in Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 applied. It added that, even

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point98">98</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary at the outset to examine the relationship between Regulations Nos 1049/2001 and 45/2001 for the purpose of
         applying the exception under Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 to this case. For that purpose, it should be borne
         in mind that they have different objectives. The first is designed to ensure the greatest possible transparency of the decision-making
         process of the public authorities and the information on which they base their decisions. It is thus designed to facilitate
         as far as possible the exercise of the right of access to documents, and to promote good administrative practices. The second
         is designed to ensure the protection of the freedoms and fundamental rights of individuals, particularly their private life,

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point99">99</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recital 15 of Regulation No 45/2001 indicates that access to documents, including conditions for access to documents containing

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point103">103</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, it is necessary to recall the most relevant provisions of Regulation No 45/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point104">104</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Article&nbsp;2(a) of Regulation No 45/2001, &#8216;personal data&#8217; means any information relating to an identified or identifiable
         natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to
         an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural
         or social identity. Personal data would therefore include, for example, surname and forenames, postal address, e-mail address,
         bank account number, credit card numbers, social security number, telephone number or driving licence number.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point105">105</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under Article&nbsp;2(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, &#8216;processing of personal data&#8217; means any operation or set of operations
         which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage,
         adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
         alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction. Therefore, communication of data, by transmission, dissemination
         or otherwise making available, falls within the definition of &#8216;processing&#8217;, and thus this regulation itself provides, independently
         of Regulation No 1049/2001, for the possibility of making certain personal data public.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point106">106</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The processing must, in addition, be lawful under Article&nbsp;5(a) or (b) of Regulation No 45/2001, according to which the processing
         must be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or for compliance with a legal obligation
         to which the controller is subject. The right of access to documents of the institutions recognised to citizens of the European
         Union and to any natural or legal person residing in or having its registered office in a Member State, laid down by Article&nbsp;2
         of Regulation No 1049/2001, constitutes a legal obligation for the purposes of Article&nbsp;5(b) of Regulation No 45/2001. Therefore,
         if Regulation No 1049/2001 requires the communication of data, which constitutes &#8216;processing&#8217; within the meaning of Article&nbsp;2(b)
         of Regulation No 45/2001, Article&nbsp;5 of that same regulation makes such communication lawful in that respect.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point107">107</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the obligation to prove the need to transfer, laid down by Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, it should be
         remembered that access to documents containing personal data falls within the application of Regulation No 1049/2001, and
         that, according to Article&nbsp;6(1) of the latter, a person requesting access is not required to justify his request and therefore
         does not have to demonstrate any interest in having access to the documents requested (see paragraph 92 above). Therefore,
         where personal data are transferred in order to give effect to Article&nbsp;2 of Regulation No 1049/2001, laying down the right
         of access to documents for all citizens of the Union, the situation falls within the application of that regulation and, therefore,
         the applicant does not need to prove the necessity of disclosure for the purposes of Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001.
         If one were to require the applicant to demonstrate the necessity of having the data transferred, as an additional condition
         imposed in Regulation No 45/2001, that requirement would be contrary to the objective of Regulation No 1049/2001, namely the
         widest possible public access to documents held by the institutions.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point108">108</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, given that access to a document will be refused under Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 where disclosure
         would undermine protection of the privacy and the integrity of the individual, a transfer that does not fall under that exception
         cannot, in principle, prejudice the legitimate interests of the person concerned within the meaning of Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation
         No 45/2001.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point109">109</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the data subject&#8217;s right to object, Article&nbsp;18 of Regulation No 45/2001 provides that that person has the right

         data relating to him or her, except in cases covered by, in particular, Article&nbsp;5(b) of that regulation. Therefore, given
         that the processing envisaged by Regulation No 1049/2001 constitutes a legal obligation for the purposes of Article&nbsp;5(b) of
         Regulation No 45/2001, the data subject does not, in principle, have a right to object. However, since Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of
         Regulation No 1049/2001 lays down an exception to that legal obligation, it is necessary to take into account, on that basis,
         the impact of the disclosure of data concerning the data subject.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point110">110</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, this Court considers that, if communication of those data would not undermine protection of the privacy and
         the integrity of the individual concerned, as required by Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001, that person&#8217;s objection

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point111">111</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it should be recalled that the provisions of Regulation No 45/2001, in so far as they govern the processing of personal
         data capable of affecting fundamental freedoms, and the right to privacy in particular, must necessarily be interpreted in
         the light of fundamental rights which, according to consistent case-law, form an integral part of the general principles of
         law with which the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance ensure compliance (see, by analogy, as regards Directive
         95/46, <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer Rundfunk</I>, paragraph 68).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point112">112</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those principles have been expressly included in Article&nbsp;6(2) EU, according to which the Union shall respect fundamental rights,
         as guaranteed by the ECHR and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles
         of Community law.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point113">113</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted in that respect that Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR, whilst laying down in paragraph 1 the principle that public
         authorities shall not interfere with the exercise of the right to private life, does acknowledge, in paragraph 2, that such
         interference is possible in so far as it &#8216;is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests
         of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for
         the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#8217;.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point114">114</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be noted that, in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, &#8216;private life&#8217; is a broad
         concept that does not lend itself to an exhaustive definition. Article 8 of the ECHR also protects the right to identity and
         personal development and also the right of any individual to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and
         with the outside world. There is no reason in principle to exclude professional or business activities from the concept of
         &#8216;private life&#8217; (see ECHR judgments in <I>Niemietz</I> v <I>Germany</I> of 16&nbsp;December 1992, Series A No&nbsp;251&#8209;B, &sect;&nbsp;29; <I>Amann </I>v <I>Switzerland </I>of 16&nbsp;February 2000, ECHR 2000&#8209;II, &sect;&nbsp;65; and <I>Rotaru </I>v <I>Romania </I>of 4&nbsp;May 2000, ECHR 2000&#8209;V, &sect;&nbsp;43). There is thus an area of interaction between the individual and others which, even in a
         public context, may fall within the concept of &#8216;private life&#8217; (see ECHR judgment in <I>Peck</I> v <I>United Kingdom</I> of 28&nbsp;January 2003, ECHR 2003&#8209;I, &sect; 57, and case-law cited).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point115">115</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to determine whether there has been a breach of Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR, it needs to be determined, first, whether
         there has been an interference in the private life of the person concerned and, secondly, if so, whether that interference
         is justified. In order to be justified, it must be in accordance with the law, pursue a legitimate aim and be necessary in
         a democratic society. Concerning that latter condition, in order to determine whether a disclosure is &#8216;necessary in a democratic
         society&#8217;, it needs to be examined whether the grounds relied on in justification are &#8216;relevant and sufficient&#8217;, and whether
         the measures adopted are proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. In cases concerning the disclosure of personal data,
         the European Court of Human Rights has recognised that the competent authorities have to be granted a certain discretion in
         order to establish a fair balance between competing public and private interests. That margin of discretion is, however, accompanied
         by judicial review, and its breadth is to be determined by reference to factors such as the nature and importance of the interests
         at stake and the seriousness of the interference (see <I>Peck</I> v <I>United Kingdom</I>, especially &sect; 76 and 77; see also the Opinion of Advocate General&nbsp;L&eacute;ger in Joined Cases C&#8209;317/04 and C&#8209;318/04 <I>Parliament </I>v <I>Council and Commission </I>[2006] ECR&nbsp;I&#8209;4721, I&#8209;4724, points 226 to 228).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point116">116</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any decision taken pursuant to Regulation No 1049/2001 must comply with Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR, in accordance with Article&nbsp;6(2)
         EU. In that regard it should be noted that Regulation No 1049/2001 determines the general principles and the limits which,
         for reasons of public or private interest, govern the exercise of the right of access to documents, in accordance with Article&nbsp;255(2)
         EC. Therefore, Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of that regulation provides an exception designed to ensure protection of the privacy and integrity

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point117">117</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, exceptions to the principle of access to documents must be interpreted restrictively. The exception under Article&nbsp;4(1)(b)

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point118">118</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be emphasised that the fact that the concept of &#8216;private life&#8217; is a broad one, in accordance with the case-law
         of the European Court of Human Rights, and that the right to the protection of personal data may constitute one of the aspects
         of the right to respect for private life (see, to that effect, the Opinion of Advocate General Leger in <I>Parliament</I> v <I>Council and Commission</I>, point 209), does not mean that all personal data necessarily fall within the concept of &#8216;private life&#8217;.

         or privacy and which should not be processed unless the data subject gives his explicit consent, which implies that not all
         data are of that nature. Such sensitive data may be included in those referred to by Article 10 of Regulation No 45/2001,

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point120">120</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the whole of the above that, in order to be able to determine whether the exception under Article&nbsp;4(1)(b)

      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point121">121</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the request for access at issue concerns the minutes of a Commission meeting, attended by officers of the DG
         for the Internal Market and Financial Services, officials of the United Kingdom Government Department of Trade and Industry
         and representatives of the CBMC. Those minutes contain a list of the participants at the meeting, classified by reference
         to the bodies in the name of which and on behalf of which those persons attended, described by their title, the initial of
         their forename, their surname and, where relevant, the service, department or association to which they belong within those
         bodies. The text of the minutes refers not to physical persons but to the bodies in question, such as the CBMC, the DG for
         the Internal Market and Financial Services, or the United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point122">122</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of meeting participants appearing in the minutes in question thus contains personal data for the purposes of Article&nbsp;2(a)

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point123">123</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the mere fact that a document contains personal data does not necessarily mean that the privacy or integrity of the

         life&#8217; within the meaning of Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR (see paragraph 114 above, and the case-law of the European Court of Human

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point124">124</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Commission itself has indicated, the persons present at the meeting of 11&nbsp;October 1996, whose names have not been disclosed,

         consequences of the decisions taken at the meeting concerned the bodies represented and not their representatives in their
         personal capacity.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point125">125</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, this Court finds that the fact that the minutes contain the names of those representatives does not
         affect the private life of the persons in question, given that they participated in the meeting as representatives of the
         bodies to which they belonged. Moreover, as noted above, the minutes do not contain any individual opinions attributable to
         those persons, but positions attributable to the bodies which those persons represented.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point126">126</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, disclosure of the names of the CBMC representatives is not capable of actually and specifically affecting the
         protection of the privacy and integrity of the persons concerned. The mere presence of the name of the person concerned in
         a list of participants at a meeting, on behalf of the body which that person represented, does not constitute such an interference,
         and the protection of the privacy and integrity of the persons concerned is not compromised.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point127">127</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That approach is not contradicted by the judgment in <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer</I><I>Rundfunk</I>, relied on by the Commission. In that judgment, the Court held that the gathering of data with names concerning the income
         of an individual, with a view to communicating those data to third parties, fell within the scope of Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR.
         It held that, whilst the mere recording by an employer of data by name relating to the remuneration paid to his employees
         could not as such constitute an interference with private life, the communication of that data to third parties, in that case
         a public authority, infringed the right of the persons concerned to respect for private life, whatever the subsequent use
         of the information thus communicated, and constituted an interference within the meaning of Article&nbsp;8 of the ECHR (<I>&Ouml;sterreichischer</I><I>Rundfunk</I>, paragraph 74). The Court added that, to establish the existence of such an interference, it did not matter whether the information
         communicated was of a sensitive character or whether the persons concerned had been inconvenienced in any way. It was sufficient
         to find that data relating to the remuneration received by an employee or pensioner had been communicated by the employer
         to a third party (<I>&Ouml;sterreichischer</I><I>Rundfunk</I>, paragraph 75).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point128">128</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Court finds that the circumstances of that case are different from those at issue here. This case falls within the application
         of Regulation No 1049/2001, and the exception laid down by Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of that regulation concerns only the disclosure
         of personal data which would undermine the protection of the privacy and integrity of the individual. As established in paragraph
         119 above, not all personal data are capable by their nature of undermining the private life of the person concerned. In the
         circumstances of this case, the mere disclosure of the participation of a physical person, acting in a professional capacity,
         as the representative of a collective body, at a meeting held with a Community institution, where the personal opinion expressed
         by that person on that occasion cannot be identified, cannot be regarded as an interference with that person&#8217;s private life.
         A distinction must thus be drawn from the situation which obtained in <I>&Ouml;sterreichischer</I><I>Rundfunk</I>, where the matter at issue was the gathering and communication by an employer to a public authority of a specific combination
         of personal data, namely the names of employees and the income received by them.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point129">129</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its judgment in <I>Lindqvist</I>, also relied upon by the Commission, the Court held that an operation consisting of referring to various persons on an internet
         page and identifying them either by name or by other means, such as their telephone number or information on their working
         conditions and pastimes, constituted &#8216;the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means&#8217; within the meaning
         of Directive 95/46 (<I>Lindqvist</I>, paragraph 27). That judgment is not decisive for the present case. As stated in the previous paragraph, this case falls
         under Regulation No 1049/2001, and the matter at issue is therefore, in addition to whether a processing of personal data
         is involved, to determine whether the disclosure of the data in question would undermine the privacy and integrity of the
         individual.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point130">130</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does the approach of the Court of First Instance contradict the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, according
         to which the right to respect for private life includes the right of the individual to establish and develop relations with
         others and may extend to professional or business activities (<I>Niemietz</I> v <I>Germany</I>, &sect;&nbsp;29; <I>Amann</I> v <I>Switzerland</I>, &sect;&nbsp;65; <I>Rotaru</I> v <I>Romania</I>, &sect;&nbsp;43, and <I>Peck</I> v <I>United</I><I>Kingdom</I>, &sect; 57).

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point131">131</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if one cannot, a priori, exclude the possibility that the concept of private life may cover certain aspects of the professional
         activity of an individual, that does not mean that any professional activity is wholly and necessarily covered by protection
         of the right to respect for private life. In this case, the Court takes the view that the mere participation of a representative
         of a collective body in a meeting held with a Community institution does not fall within the sphere of that person&#8217;s private
         life, so that the disclosure of minutes revealing his presence at that meeting cannot constitute an interference with his
         private life.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point132">132</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the disclosure of the names in question does not lead to an interference with the private life of the persons who participated

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point134">134</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Commission does not claim that, in this case, at the time of the gathering of the data, namely at the meeting
         of 11&nbsp;October 1996, it undertook to keep the names of the participants secret, or that the participants requested at that
         meeting that the Commission not reveal their identity. It was not until 1999, when the Commission requested authorisation
         to reveal their identity, that certain participants refused to allow their name to be disclosed.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point135">135</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since in this case the condition under Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation No 1049/2001 that protection of the relevant person&#8217;s
         privacy and integrity must be affected has not been fulfilled, refusal by that person cannot prevent disclosure. Moreover,
         the Commission has not even attempted to establish that the persons who refused, after the meeting, to allow disclosure of
         their name had demonstrated that protection of their privacy and integrity would be affected by disclosure.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point136">136</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be noted in that respect that, in the end, the Commission received refusals from only two of the persons in
         question, and that it was not able to contact the three other persons in question, whose names it had also not disclosed (see
         paragraph 35 above).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point137">137</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persons who participated in that meeting had no grounds for believing that the opinions expressed in the name of and on
         behalf of the bodies they represented enjoyed confidential treatment. This was a meeting held in the context of proceedings
         for failure to fulfil obligations. Although, under such proceedings, the applicant may, pursuant to internal Commission rules,
         choose confidential treatment, there is no provision for such treatment in respect of the other persons participating in the
         investigations. Moreover, since the Commission disclosed the minutes, albeit with certain names removed, it clearly took the
         view that this was not information covered by business secrecy. Regulation No 45/2001 does not require the Commission to keep
         secret the names of persons who communicate opinions or information to it concerning the exercise of its functions.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point138">138</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Commission&#8217;s argument that the applicant has never satisfied the obligation to prove the necessity for transfer,
         as provided under Article&nbsp;8(b) of Regulation No 45/2001, it is sufficient to note that, as held in paragraphs 107 and 108
         above, where the disclosure gives effect to Article&nbsp;2 of Regulation No 1049/2001 and does not fall under the exception laid
         down by Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) of that regulation, the applicant has no need to prove necessity for the purposes of Article&nbsp;8(b)
         of Regulation No 45/2001. Therefore, the Commission&#8217;s argument that communication of the identity of the participants would
         not have thrown any additional light on the decision to close the proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations cannot succeed.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point139">139</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission therefore erred in law by holding, in the contested decision, that the applicant had not established either
         an express and legitimate purpose or any need to obtain the names of the five persons who participated in the meeting and
         who, after that meeting, objected to communication of their identity to the applicant.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point140">140</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to examine the application of the exception under the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001.

      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point141">141</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, the institutions must refuse access to a document where
         disclosure would undermine the protection of the purpose of inspections, investigations and audits, unless there is an overriding
         public interest in disclosure.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point142">142</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, by confusion, the applicant cites in its application Article&nbsp;4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, its application should
         be interpreted as relying on the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of that regulation, since it is on that provision that the Commission
         based, in the alternative, its refusal to grant access to the full minutes. In any event, at the hearing, the applicant referred
         to the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point143">143</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for the institution to assess in each individual case whether the documents disclosure of which has been requested actually
         fall within the exceptions set out in the regulation concerning access to documents.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point144">144</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The document at issue in this case is the minutes of a meeting which took place in the context of proceedings for failure
         to fulfil obligations.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point145">145</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact that the document at issue is linked to proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations, and thus concerns
         investigations, cannot in itself justify applicant of the exception pleaded (see, to that effect, <I>Bavarian Lager</I> v <I>Commission</I>, paragraph 41). As stated above, any exception to the right of access to documents under Regulation No 1049/2001 must be
         interpreted and applied strictly (Case T&#8209;20/99 <I>Denkavit Nederland</I> v <I>Commission</I> [2000] ECR II&#8209;3011, paragraph 45).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point146">146</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, it should be remembered that the Commission&#8217;s investigations were already over at the time the contested
         decision was adopted, on 18&nbsp;March 2004. Indeed, it had already closed the infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom
         without taking any further action on 10&nbsp;December 1997.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point147">147</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It thus needs to be examined in this case whether the document concerning investigations was covered by the exception under
         the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, whereas the investigation was complete and infringement proceedings
         closed for more than six years.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point148">148</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of First Instance has already had occasion to hold that the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001,
         which is designed to protect &#8216;the purpose of inspections, investigations and audits&#8217;, applies only where disclosure of the
         documents in question risks jeopardising the completion of the inspections, investigations or audits (<I>Franchet and Byk</I>, paragraph 109).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point149">149</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that that exception, from the way in which it is formulated, is designed not to protect investigations
         as such but the purpose of those investigations, which, as is shown in the judgment in <I>Bavarian</I><I>Lager</I> v <I>Commission</I> (paragraph 46), consists, in the case of proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations, in causing the Member State concerned
         to comply with Community law. In this case, the Commission had already closed the infringement proceedings against the United
         Kingdom on 10&nbsp;December 1997, since the latter had amended the legislation at issue and the purpose of the investigations had
         thus been achieved. Thus, at the time the contested decision was adopted, no investigation whose purpose could have been jeopardised
         by disclosure of the minutes containing the names of certain representatives of bodies which participated in the meeting of
         11&nbsp;October 1996 was in progress, with the result that the exception under the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No
         1049/2001 cannot be applied in this case.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point150">150</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to justify its refusal to disclose the whole of the minutes in question, the Commission further argues that, if the
         names of persons who have supplied information to the Commission could be disclosed against their wishes, the Commission could
         be deprived of a precious source of information, which could compromise its ability to conduct investigations into presumed
         infringements of Community legislation.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point151">151</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard it should be noted that, according to consistent case-law, the assessment required for processing an application
         for access to documents must be of a concrete nature. First, the mere fact that a document concerns an interest protected
         by an exception is not sufficient to justify that exception being applied (see, to that effect, <I>Denkavit Nederland</I>, paragraph 45). Secondly, the risk of a protected interest being affected must be reasonably foreseeable and not merely hypothetical.
         Therefore, the assessment which the institution must undertake in order to apply an exception must be carried out in a concrete
         way and be apparent from the grounds of the decision (Case T&#8209;188/98 <I>Kuijer</I> v <I>Council</I> [2000] ECR&nbsp;II&#8209;1959, paragraph 38; Case T&#8209;2/03 <I>Verein f&uuml;r Konsumenteninformation</I> v <I>Commission</I> [2005] ECR&nbsp;II&#8209;1121, paragraphs 69 and 72; and <I>Franchet and Byk</I>, paragraph 115).
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point152">152</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, whilst it must be acknowledged that the need to preserve the anonymity of persons providing the Commission with information
         on possible infringements of Community law constitutes a legitimate objective capable of justifying the Commission in not
         granting complete, or even partial, access to certain documents, the fact remains that, in this case, the Commission ruled
         in the abstract on the effect which disclosure of the document concerned with names might have on its investigative activity,
         without demonstrating to a sufficient legal standard that disclosure of that document would actually and specifically undermine
         protection of the purposes of investigations. Thus it has not been shown in this case that the purpose of investigations was
         actually and specifically jeopardised by the disclosure of data requested six years after the closure of those investigations.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point153">153</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, as stated above, the procedure for failure to fulfil obligations does not provide for confidential treatment for
         persons who participated in the investigations, save for the complainant. It appears that, if the Commission disclosed the
         minutes in question without the names of persons who had not given authorisation for their names to be disclosed, that is
         because it considered, in principle, that disclosure of that document did not fall within the exception under the third indent
         of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point154">154</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, the Commission&#8217;s reference during the hearing to Case 145/83 <I>Adams</I> v <I>Commission</I> [1985] ECR&nbsp;3539 concerning the confidentiality of information covered by business secrecy is not relevant. That case concerned
         an informer who had denounced anti-competitive practices of his employer and whose identity the Commission had to keep secret.
         That informer had specifically asked it not to reveal his identity from the beginning of the proceedings. In this case, however,
         as stated above, the Commission has not shown that, at the time they participated in the meeting in question, the persons
         concerned had reasonable grounds for believing that they enjoyed confidential treatment of any kind, or that they had asked
         the Commission not to reveal their identity. Moreover, as stated in paragraph 137 above, given that the Commission disclosed
         the minutes, albeit with certain names removed, it must have taken the view that this was not information covered by business
         secrecy. Finally, the Commission has not put forward any argument to demonstrate in what way disclosure of the names of the
         persons who refused their consent could have harmed any investigations involved in this case.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point155">155</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those circumstances, the arguments based on protection of the purposes of inspections and investigations cannot succeed.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point156">156</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore no need to examine the possible existence of a higher public interest justifying disclosure of the document
         concerned.
      </P>
      <P class="C01PointnumeroteAltN"><A NAME="point157">157</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows from the whole of the above that the full minutes of the meeting of 11&nbsp;October 1996, containing all the names,
         does not fall within the exceptions under Article&nbsp;4(1)(b) or the third indent of Article&nbsp;4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001.
