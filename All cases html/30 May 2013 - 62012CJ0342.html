Such an obligation amounts to allowing any employee of the undertaking concerned to gain access to the personal data contained in that record, in breach of the obligation, set out in Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46, to ensure the security of such data.

As the Portuguese government rightly pointed out, all controllers of personal data must, under Article 17(1) of Directive 95/46, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that only those persons duly authorised to access the personal data in question are entitled to respond to a request for access from a third party.</p>

Secondly, that record allows the assessment of average working times, for the purposes of monitoring, inter alia, working hours exemptions.
