               <p class="normal">The Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) refers to the academic disagreement relating to whether, in order to determine whether someone is identifiable, an ‘objective’ or ‘relative’ criterion must be used. The application of an ‘objective’ criterion would have the consequence that data such as the IP addresses at issue in the main proceedings may be regarded, at the end of the period of use of the websites at issue, as being personal data even if only a third party is able to determine the identity of the data subject, that third party being, in the present case, Mr Breyer’s internet service provider, which stored the additional data enabling his identification by means of those IP addresses. According to a ‘relative’ criterion, such data may be regarded as personal data in relation to an entity such as Mr Breyer’s internet service provider because they allow the user to be precisely identified (see, in that connection, judgment of 24 November 2011, Scarlet Extended, <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A771&locale=en"

               <p class="normal">Whereas Article 7(f) of that directive refers, in a general manner, to ‘the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed’, Paragraph 15 of the TMG authorises the service provider to collect and use personal data of a user only in so far as that is necessary in order to facilitate, and charge for, the particular use of electronic media. Therefore, Paragraph 15 of the TMG precludes the storage of personal data, after the consultation of online media, in a general manner in order to guarantee the use of those media. The German Federal institutions, which provide online media services, may also have a legitimate interest in ensuring, in addition to the specific use of their publicly accessible websites, the continued functioning of those websites.</p>
